"Standard Group Faces Another Major Hurdle, Given 2-Day Ultimatum","Media giant Standard Group has been given 48 hours to apologise to five individuals over a recent exposé news story, or face legal action.
The five individuals, Careen Cherotich, Elizabeth Waithera, Antonella Kakuko, Don Kamau, and Samuel Mundia, through their lawyers, served the media house with a demand letter accusing it of defamation, character assassination, and violation of constitutional rights.
In the letter dated June 27 and addressed to the media house's Chief Executive Officer, the individuals accused the Standard of peddling 'cock and bull sensationalism' and subjecting their clients to reputational ruin.
''You have plunged yourself into phenomenal trouble for defamation, vilification, and repulsive character assassination of our clients. This is in respect to malicious falsehoods and self-promotional editions that you published on diverse platforms on or around 24th June 2025,'' the letter read in part.

In the referred news article, The Standard accused the five of coordinating WhatsApp groups and recruiting goons to disrupt the peaceful protests. They detailed how the network extended from senior State House officials, Members of Parliament, government officials, and Members of the County Assembly (MCAs), to grassroots mobilisers in some of Nairobi’s informal settlements.
They also disclosed how the National Police Service (NPS) was allegedly privy to the situation despite previously assuring protesters of their safety during the protests.
The article painted Cherotich as fund mobilizer from the the Office of the Chief of Staff, Waithera as a coordinator linked to the Nairobi County and Kakuko as a feared 'arsonist-in-chief', controlling digital disinformation campaigns.
It further identified Kamau as a strategist who allegedly incentivized the theft of protesters' phones, while Mundia was described as a political enforcer allegedly linked to street-level gangs.
As captured in the demand letter, the five individuals' names and photos were splashed across various platforms of the media house, including print and digital editions of the story, with allegations also posted on X, Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram.
They have given Standard Group 48 hours to retract all defamatory statements, falsehoods, fabrications, innuendos, images, or likenesses posted on all their platforms.
They have also been ordered to apologize on all their platforms in the same intensity with which they reported the defamatory piece and to permanently cease and desist from further defamation or publication of falsehoods in relation to the individuals.
''Unless you comply with the terms of this demand within the next 48 hours, we are under firm instructions to launch suitable legal proceedings against you, to uphold our clients’ rights, without further reference and at your own peril as to costs and consequences,'' the letter concluded.

Questions as Man Behind Protest 'Time Table' Still Missing,"Amnesty Kenya has demanded the release of blogger and activist Ndiangui Kinyagia, who has been missing since Saturday, June 21, following a reported raid at his residence in Kinoo.
The calls come at a time when pressure continues to mount on authorities to account for the blogger and activists' whereabouts, six days since he went missing.
Amnesty Kenya has attributed the abduction to officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI). They are demanding Kinyagia's release or for him to be presented before a court of law, instead of him being held incommunicado.
''Free Ndiangui Kinyagia. He was last seen on June 21 after a reported raid by DCI officers at his home in Kinoo. We call for his immediate release. If he is accused of any crime, let him be presented before a court of law—not held incommunicado,'' Amnesty demanded.

According to family members, Kinyagia, a 31-year-old IT expert and outspoken online commentator, disappeared under suspicious circumstances after a group of men believed to be DCI officers surrounded his apartment complex in Kinoo.
Witnesses say the officers arrived in multiple unmarked vehicles and camped outside the premises for nearly nine hours before forcibly entering his home.
According to the family, they reported the incident to the Kinoo police station, but the officers denied having knowledge of the operation or Kinyagia’s whereabouts.
Reacting on his disappearance, activist Boniface Mwangi has raised concerns that the blogger may be held by the National Intelligence Service, where he might be going through torture.
''This man is being held, and likely tortured in a detention hole run by the National Intelligence Service and Directorate of Criminal Investigations,'' Mwangi alleged.
According to Mwangi, Kinyagia's forced disappearance is a reflection of the continued injustice to youths and abuse of power by leaders who are after Kenyans expressing their opinion.
Kinyagia is the youth behind the Wednesday, June 25, timetable, which detailed the itinerary of how the events of the protests would unfold from start to finish. Unfortunately, despite outlining the events, Kinyagia missed the protests, and he has been missing since he was forcefully taken.
The Law Society of Kenya (LSK) also took up the case, with President Faith Odhiambo describing the incident as a dangerous erosion of constitutional protections. The LSK is preparing a court application to compel the police to produce Kinyagia and explain the circumstances of the raid.

"I'm Ready to Go, But on One Condition - Ruto Says","President William Ruto has condemned the recent demonstrations, witnessed on Wednesday, June 25, terming them a well-calculated move to cause anarchy and destroy the country.
The Head of State, who spoke on Friday afternoon during the World MSME Day in Nairobi, said what transpired on Wednesday was not protests, but hooliganism disguised as peaceful processions.
While expressing his frustrations over the demonstrations, Ruto said he was ready to step down, but only if those opposing his governance showed him their better plan for the nation.
He urged Kenyans who are against his regime to seek change through the ballot in 2027 instead of using inciteful slogans such as 'one term' and 'must go' in rallies and protests.

""If you persuade us, I can also go and concentrate on farming and help in food security, if you have a better plan, but do not burn the country,"" President Ruto said.
""If it is Ruto must go, then tell me how you want me to go. What do you mean by Ruto must go? Look for a better plan and convince the people of Kenya.  You cannot replace a plan you don’t like with no plan,"" he added.
Of much disappointment to the President was the burning of buildings and the looting of businesses, which he said left investments worth billions wiped out in hours.
According to him, the biggest victims of this week's protests were the hard-working traders and entrepreneurs, who woke up early only to find their businesses reduced to ashes. 
Ruto further accused a section of opposition politicians of allegedly inciting youthful Kenyans into demonstrations, warning of dire consequences against the sponsors of the Wednesday protests. 
To ensure justice for those affected by the protests, the President ordered the Inspector General of Police, Douglas Kanja, to immediately expedite investigations and arrest those involved in the recent destruction and looting of property. 
""The perpetrators of violence, looting, and destruction during the June 25 protests must be identified and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, swiftly and decisively,"" Ruto ordered.
“I expect the Inspector General of Police and all relevant security agencies to conduct immediate, thorough, and speedy investigations into the violent protests on June 25,"" he added.

I Dared to Try: Faith Kipyegon Speaks After Her 4-Minute Mile Race,"Faith Kipyegon has addressed her attempt to become the first-ever woman to run a mile in under four minutes, following her race on Thursday, June 26, 2025.
In her statement released on Friday, June 27, Kipyegon said that she attempted the race to show the world that people need to push themselves.
“I dared to try,  ‘Breaking4’ was about showing the world that we have to push ourselves. This one was for all the young girls and women out there to show that you have to believe in yourself in everything you do,” she said.
She also thanked everyone, including the organisers and fans, for the support they showed her.

“I want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for all the support I’ve received. From my whole team, Nike, the pacemakers, the organisers, and fans from all around the world. It’s not if, it’s when,” she added.
Kipyegon completed the mile in 4:06.42, falling short of the sub-4-minute barrier she was pursuing. Nonetheless, this was faster than her own 2023 world record of 4:07.64.
She remained on pace through 800 m (about 2:00.75) but began to slow during the final lap, finishing the last 400 m in roughly 64.6 seconds 
Despite the heartbreak, Kipyegon remains the fastest woman to run a mile in history.
After the race, while addressing the press, she strongly hinted at taking another stab at the challenge to run the mile again.
She added that she would not be discouraged, predicting that the 4-minute mile barrier would eventually be broken by her or another athlete.
""I feel good; I've tried. I have proven what's possible. It's only a matter of time, and I know one day a woman will run under 4 minutes. If it is not me, it will be someone else.""
""Even without these conditions, I will still go for it. I want to thank everyone who came to cheer me on. This was really special, and I am so grateful I have proved to the world that everything is possible,"" she said.

Police Officer Kills His Wife & Man in Suspected Love Triangle,"A night of frivolous enjoyment and merry-making took an unexpected turn after a drunken police officer opened fire in a nightclub, shooting his lover and another man dead.
The incident, which occurred during a night of merrymaking on Thursday, June 26, is said to have turned deadly when the officer discovered that his lover was in another relationship with another man in what turned out to be a suspected love triangle.
The officer, a constable, was armed with an AK-47 rifle and proceeded to open fire in the pub while drunk, prompting revellers to raise an alarm by calling police officers.
After realising what he had done, the officer attempted to flee via a motorcycle, but the Turbo Sub County Police Commander and Directorate of Criminal Investigations officers arrived on time, proceeding to arrest him.

Upon arresting him, the officers disarmed the cop and recovered the rifle, which had twenty rounds of ammunition.
According to a police report, the pub was reportedly owned by the officer’s lover, who was cohabiting with another man. 
Further, the report detailed that the officer had been assigned the firearm for night duties but later used a motorbike to head to the pub where the incident occurred.
In the ensuing melee, another man was injured by a ricocheting bullet during the shooting and was later rushed to the hospital for treatment.
Meanwhile, police disclosed that the bodies of the deceased were taken to the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary pending post-mortem examinations.
The arrested officer is currently in police custody as officers commence investigations into the circumstances that led to the shooting at the entertainment joint.
Cases of police officers opening fire on citizens and even their colleagues are not far and few between, with numerous incidents of such nature happening in various areas of the country.
Last year, revellers at the Imperial Lounge in Yatta, Machakos County, had to scamper for safety when a police officer fired 30 rounds of ammunition from an AK-47 rifle in the presence of his superiors after a romantic dispute in the wee hours of Friday, December 27.
In February this year, a police officer opened fire on his colleague, killing him instantly, following an altercation as the two were leaving a Nairobi club. 
In March, a tragic shooting incident involving officers from Gigiri Police Station unfolded on the evening of Sunday, March 9, after a police officer allegedly opened fire on his colleagues, killing one and injuring another in the process.

Two Killed Along Nairobi-Mombasa Road,"Two people are feared dead and three others injured in a road accident along the Mombasa-Nairobi highway at Kiongwani area, Makueni County.
The crash involved a pickup truck transporting avocados towards Nairobi and a fuel tanker heading in the opposite direction.
According to witnesses, the two vehicles collided head-on, killing two passengers who were in the pickup truck on the spot.
It is reported that the tanker and pickup drivers, however, sustained serious injuries and were rushed to Sultan Hamud Sub-County Hospital before being referred to Makindu Level 5 Hospital for further treatment.

On the same morning, heavy traffic built up along the busy Nairobi-Mombasa road after a road accident in the Maungu area, Taita Taveta County.
According to the Long Distance Drivers and Conductors Association, the accident involved a Canter lorry and an LPG tanker.
An image seen by Kenyans.co.ke shows that the crash caused significant damage to the tanker's cabin. The tanker rolled over and blocked part of the road.
The canter was pushed onto the wrong side of the road, possibly because the driver was overtaking another vehicle when the accident happened.
At the time of publication, the condition of both drivers was unknown, and there had been no reports of fatalities.
On May 13, another fatal accident occurred along the same stretch, where two people lost their lives after the matatu they were travelling in got involved in a road accident at Malili.
This matatu was reportedly ferrying a group of passengers who had booked it for a weekend getaway to Zaina Falls in Nyeri County.
The National Transport and Safety Authority earlier revealed that the leading causes of these accidents include speeding, reckless overtaking, drunk driving, failure by pedestrians to use designated crossings, and poor road conditions in certain areas.

Kenya Unveils New Strategy to Deal With Haiti Gangs,"Haiti's Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission is entering a new phase, with plans to establish Forward Operating Bases (FOBs), particularly within key areas of the capital, Port-au-Prince. 
MSS Commander Godfrey Otunge announced this development on Thursday during the mission's first anniversary celebration, stating that these bases are crucial for enhancing intelligence gathering operations.
The move is part of the broader strategy by the peacekeepers to deal with dreaded Caribbean gangs, who have taken over key government institutions within Port-au-Prince.
During the event, the MSS Commander sent a strong warning to the gang leaders and their networks, stating that it would no longer be business as usual.

He noted that the peacekeepers were now smarter, more focused and determined to restore peace and stability in the war-ravaged nation. He also commended the peacekeepers, terming them a beacon of hope and a symbol of the power of international cooperation.  
The police boss also thanked countries that have supported the mission including the United States, Dominican Republic, Spain, Japan and the United Kingdom. He also commented on the MSS's new Complaint Reporting Mechanism, which was recently launched to address cases of sexual exploitation and other forms of human rights violations by the mission personnel.
Additionally, the MSS Commander assured the peacekeepers of the mission's commitment to address their challenges, including logistics and financial problems.
Otunge's speech during the MSS mission's anniversary comes hardly three months following the disappearance of Benedict Kabiru, a Kenyan officer who was part of the peacekeeping mission.
According to MSS Spokesperson Jack Ombaka, Kabiru went missing during an operation in Savien region, which is located 92 kilometres north of Port-au-Prince.
Despite attempts to trace him, his whereabouts remain unknown despite his family's plea for the government's quick intervention on the matter. 
However, on March 27 this year, Haiti's Presidential Transition Council claimed that Kaburi was shot dead during an operation alongside his fellow peacekeepers, and the body was taken away by the gangs.

What You Need to Know Before Filing Your Annual Returns Ahead of Deadline,"The clock is ticking for millions of Kenyans as the June 30 deadline for income tax returns rapidly approaches. Filing your annual tax returns isn't just an option for salaried workers, business owners, or farmers; it is a mandatory legal requirement, and failing to comply carries repercussions.
For many, especially those who have not filed in multiple years, this deadline presents a unique challenge. This oversight is a risky move, as it exposes them to hefty accrued penalties, which can be a significant financial drain, especially considering that filing the returns themselves is a free service.
Despite robust mechanisms and additional support provided by the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) to assist with filing returns, many Kenyans remain confused, unsure of what to file, or unaware that they even need to file their returns. For starters, any Kenyan with an active KRA Personal Identification Number (PIN) is legally required to file an annual return even if you didn’t earn any income.
This means, if you are formally employed, you must file a return even if your employer already deducted PAYE (Pay As You Earn). If you are self-employed, run a business, earn rental income, or farm, you are required to declare your income. If you had no income, you still need to file a NIL return.

This process becomes a particularly hard nut to crack for individuals with several years of unfiled returns. Such delays are risky, exposing them to accumulating penalties, which can be a costly affair, particularly when filing returns is in itself free.
If one misses the deadline, KRA imposes a hefty five per cent of the tax due or Ksh2,000, whichever is higher, for those who miss the filing deadline. For late payment, KRA imposes a penalty of five per cent of the unpaid tax, plus one per cent interest every month until it is paid.
Accumulated penalties can easily affect your tax record, so it is better to file, even with incomplete information, rather than miss the deadline entirely. 
In case one misses filing their returns multiple times, the system may show an error message like: “You must file previous returns before uploading” when they attempt to file returns. This means you need to clear all past pending returns before you submit your current one. Start with the oldest year and move forward.
The general process of filing multiple years of unfiled returns encompasses several steps. One first needs to understand their tax obligations for each year they missed. This entails determining your income status for each year missed, depending on whether you were employed, self-employed or had no income at all.
Next, you need to gather all the necessary documents. If you were employed, ensure you have your P9 forms for each relevant year. These forms summarize your employment income and PAYE (Pay As You Earn) deductions.
Kenya Revenue Authority offices PHOTO KRA
If you had business, rental, or other income, gather your books of accounts, income statements, balance sheets, and any withholding tax certificates for each year. In addition, one needs to have a record of their reliefs and deductions, and collect any documents supporting applicable tax reliefs, such as insurance policy certificates, mortgage certificates for each year.
Once all that is gathered, the next step is to access the iTax portal and log in. To log in, one needs to enter their KRA PIN and password. If you have forgotten your password, use the ""Forgot Password"" feature to reset it via your registered email address. If your email is no longer active, you will need to contact KRA for an email change
To file each year’s returns, one needs to click the “Returns” tab and select “File Return.” Next is to choose the relevant tax obligation (e.g., Income Tax - Resident Individual for most individuals).
When prompted, crucially, select the specific year of income you want to file for. You will need to do this for each missed year, starting from the earliest outstanding year. Thereafter, download the relevant Excel or ODS return template provided by the system for that specific year.
Afterwards, one needs to ensure macros are enabled in the downloaded Excel form. This is essential for the form to function correctly. The next step is to carefully fill in all required details for that specific year. Input your income (from P9s or other records), PAYE deductions, and any applicable tax reliefs.
After filling, click on the ""Validate"" button within the Excel sheet. This will check for errors and generate a zipped file of your return in your ""Documents"" folder. Afterwards, return to the iTax portal, select the tax period again, and upload the zipped file. Next, agree to the terms and conditions, click ""Submit,"" and then download the acknowledgment receipt. This is your proof of submission.
It is important that if you make a mistake, you can still file an amended return later. More significantly, KRA had introduced the Tax Amnesty Program, where if you owed taxes before December 31, 2023, the programme allows you to pay the principal amount only, and have penalties and interest waived, provided you settle the amount by June 30, 2025.
If you had already paid all your principal tax for periods up to December 31, 2023, you automatically qualify for a waiver of the related penalties and interest. No formal application is required for this category. 
However, if you had outstanding principal tax for periods up to December 31, 2023, you needed to apply to the KRA Commissioner for the amnesty. You would also need to propose a payment plan for the outstanding principal taxes, ensuring they are fully paid by June 30, 2025.

Families of June 25 Victims Issue Demands to Wetangula,"The families of the victims who lost their lives during the June 25, 2024, protests have filed a petition to the National Assembly as they continue to push for justice following the events that left several youths dead.
Shared by activist Boniface Mwangi, the petition casts a spotlight on the alarming rise in alleged extrajudicial killings, urging a swift and decisive response from both the National Assembly and Senate.
The petition, which highlights data from the 2024 Missing Voices Report, documents at least 159 cases of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances.
According to the report, most of these incidents occurred between June and August 2024, during mass protests against the 2024 Finance Bill.
Speaker of the National Assembly Moses Wetangula making remarks during the joint State of the Nation address by President William Ruto on Thursday, November 21, 2024. NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
In the petition, the families asked Parliament to conduct a comprehensive investigation into all the extrajudicial killings and abductions documented in the report.
They are also calling for the establishment of a parliamentary committee to investigate the involvement of security agencies and other individuals in these killings, to provide compensation to affected families, and to speed up the prosecution of pending cases.
The petition also calls for immediate reforms in the security sector, implementation of the TJRC recommendations, and establishment of an independent commission to monitor and report on security forces' compliance with human rights standards in their operations were also made.
The families brought to the Parliament's attention that despite President William Ruto's promise that extrajudicial killings would come to an end, the country is still witnessing these deaths, citing the case of Albert Ojwang.
They expressed frustrations that efforts to have their grievances met have continued to fall on deaf ears, now calling on the attention of the National Assembly.
""We have made the best efforts to have these matters addressed by the relevant authorities, including the NPS, IPOA, and NCHR through statements, calls to action, cases filed in court, and engagement with various government ministries, all of which have failed to give a satisfactory response,"" the families revealed.
The petition pointed to stresses that young Kenyans, particularly peaceful protesters, content creators, and online influencers, were being abducted, tortured, and in some cases executed, in what the petitioners termed as a campaign to silence dissent.
Meanwhile, while these families, activists, and relevant stakeholders continue to demand justice, more Kenyans lost their lives during the commemorative protests on Wednesday, June 25.

Mudavadi acknowledged the support they received from members of the diplomatic community for the right to peaceful assembly and demonstration.
He informed the diplomats that the country regrets that the protests were marred by incidents of violence, some of which targeted women, members of the public, and business owners.
""It is evident that at a certain point, the demonstration was co-opted by elements pursuing ulterior, self-serving agendas, thereby undermining the legitimacy of the initial cause,"" part of the statement reads.
Mudavadi said that given the geopolitical challenges and ongoing security concerns in Africa, Kenya has placed paramount importance on maintaining national security and stability.
He, however, praised police officers for their efforts, saying that their actions during the protest prevented further escalation.
""We commend our security forces for their professionalism and restraint in the face of extreme provocations. Their action prevented further escalation, and we appreciate their dedication to maintaining law and order under challenging circumstances,"" he added.
Mudavadi clarified that Article 33 grants freedom of expression, but it restricts the freedom of spreading propaganda for war, hate speech, incitement, or advocacy of hatred that may amount to ethnic incitement or incitements to cause harm.
He also noted that demonstration organizers have the responsibility to ensure demonstrations remain peaceful, adding that it remains unclear who organized these recent events and whether they fulfilled their legal obligations.

Churches Directed to Change Sunday's Sermon,"All of the churches that are members of the National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) have been asked to use this Sunday's service to reflect on the current state of the nation.
The council on Thursday evening said that this coming Sunday, June 29, the clergy would dedicate a substantial portion of their service to discuss matters concerning the youth and accountability within the government.
Additionally, the council further urged its member churches to dedicate services to mobilise financial support for families that have lost their loved ones during protests.
""To all our clergy and church leaders, we request you to dedicate the worship services on Sunday, June 29, 2025, to discuss matters on the youth, justice, and accountability,"" the council said in a statement on Thursday, June 26.

""Let it also be a day to mobilise material and financial support for the families that have been bereaved and the youth who have been injured or maimed in the demonstrations,"" it added.
Additionally, NCCK stressed that churches should remain vigilant and refrain from giving politicians a chance to dispense their political opinions inside church buildings, especially during this time when the political tension in the country is accelerating.
The clergy were further directed not to disclose the amount of contributions a politician donates to the church, regardless of who they are.
""We once again ask you, Brothers and Sisters, to sanitise our churches and sanctuaries and bring to an end all manner of political interests in places of worship. Refuse to sit down and listen to anyone playing politics in the church,"" NCCK stated.
""We encourage you to hold your clergy accountable by demanding that all contributions be made secretly, regardless of the giver. Let us keep our churches clean,"" it added.
Politicians, on the other hand, were urged to be at the forefront in advocating for peace, regardless of their political affiliations, and focus more on effective service to citizens.
The statement comes just hours after the Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen slammed the leadership of the church in Kenya and the International community for their recurrent opposition against the government, and siding with anarchists, especially after the protests which took place on Wednesday, June 25, which left over 400 injured and over 10 dead.
According to Murkomen, it was not right for the churches to remain silent after goons took over Wednesday's demonstrations and caused the destruction of property, especially in Nairobi.
''I know that there will be no bishop or church member, neither Catholic nor Anglican, who will come out to defend the police. Nobody will speak about how the police were injured,'' Murkomen stated.

"Moses Kuria Slams Ichung’wah, Mbarire & 3 Others for Mt Kenya Downfall","Senior advisor in the Council of Economic Advisors, Moses Kuria, has publicly accused Kenya Kwanza allies of betraying the Mt Kenya region by leading its people away from former President Uhuru Kenyatta.
In a statement on Thursday evening, Kuria named Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung'wah, Embu Governor Cecily Mbarire, former Agriculture CS Mithika Linturi, and MP Ndindi Nyoro to be at the centre of what he termed as the region's downfall.
He also named former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua and himself as part of those who influenced the region to abandon the former Head of State.
“My good friend Rigathi Gachagua. You, Ichungwa, Ndindi, Mbarire, Linturi, and I lied to Mt Kenya to abandon Uhuru Kenyatta,” Kuria said.

According to Kuria, the move was a political miscalculation that has plunged the region into insecurity and immense losses.
The statements were triggered by the deadly chaos in parts of the country where protests erupted, leading to the deaths of many youths, including some from the region.
Kuria accused the former DP of sponsoring the chaos and advised him to refrain from such since it was costing the region, not just in their businesses, but also in loss of lives.
“Did we do that only to convert them into criminals destroying our very own properties and businesses? You know this is not right, brother. Stop it,” Kuria said.
Before the 2022 general election, former President Uhuru Kenyatta made several public appeals to the Mt Kenya region urging them not to vote for then-Deputy President William Ruto, and instead support his preferred successor, Raila Odinga.
Despite Uhuru's advice, warning, and endorsement, the majority of Mt Kenya voters backed Ruto in the 2022 election. A move, Kuria says, has largely contributed to the region's downfall.
Kuria's sentiments come hours after pro-government leaders called for Gachagua's arrest for allegedly inciting Kenyans into violence for his political gain.
The leaders accused the former DP of allegedly hiring goons from central Kenya to destroy properties in Nairobi's Central Business District (CBD).
In a quick rejoinder, Gachagua defended the protests, accusing the government of orchestrating the chaos.

United Nations Criticises Ruto Govt After Deadly Protests,"The United Nations Human Rights Commission has condemned the alleged shooting of protesters by police officers during Wednesday, June 25, demonstrations.
In a statement on Thursday, June 26, the humanitarian organisation termed the shooting of protesters as 'deeply concerning', accusing President William Ruto's administration of contravening the law.
According to the UN, under international human rights law, the use of lethal force by the police should only be applied when strictly necessary to protect life or prevent serious injury from an imminent threat.
The UN also claimed that Ruto's administration contradicted the Kenyan Constitution by attempting to stop citizens from exercising their rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression.
A photo collage of President William Ruto (left) and Secretary General to the United Nations Antonio Guterres PCS ANADOLU
""We are deeply concerned by reports of several deaths of protesters and many more injuries to protesters and police officers during demonstrations in Kenya on Wednesday,"" the UN noted.
""The rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression are cornerstones of the rule of law and must be respected and upheld by all,"" the organisation added.
While denouncing the use of force against peaceful protesters, the UN called on the government to expedite its investigations and ensure the arrest of police officers who shot at protesters.
To ensure timely justice for those affected, the international organisation urged the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) to conclusively probe police misconduct during the protests.
""We underscore the importance of prompt, thorough, independent and transparent investigations to bring those responsible to justice per due process and to prevent recurrence,"" read part of the statement by the UN.
The UN's statement comes a day after reports emerged that over 16 people had died from the June 25 protests, with reports further indicating that the deaths were as a result of alleged police brutality.
On June 25, thousands of Kenyans across the country took to the streets to commemorate last year's killing of youthful protesters outside the Parliament Buildings.
However, the protests turned chaotic, with videos and images shared widely showing citizens clashing with police officers who were forced to lob tear gas canisters at the protesters to disperse them.

Murkomen Issues Fresh Orders to Police After Attack on Police Stations,"Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen has issued a new directive to police officers, instructing them to shoot individuals who pose a direct threat to officers or attack police stations.
“Tumeambia polisi, mtu yeyote ambaye atakaribia police station, piga yeye risasi (We have directed the police that anyone who dares approach a police station with criminal intent, shoot them),” Murkomen directed.
The CS was addressing security personnel on Thursday when he attributed the leniency by police officers to the rising cases of lawlessness, where criminals storm police stations and steal guns.
Murkomen expressed frustration over a system that he claims has allowed repeat offenders to be released on lenient bond terms, only for them to return and challenge law enforcement.

“They get released on small bond, return to fight police, and even mock them. This must come to an end,'' the CS noted.
His remarks immediately raised concerns among Kenyans who were listening to him, as they quickly questioned whether he meant anyone who approached police stations, including those who need help or are reporting cases.
In a quick clarification, the CS clarified that the shoot-to-kill order was exclusively for thugs who attack police stations and steal guns from there.
“Those looking for help, shelter, and reporting cases are okay, but people who come to snatch guns from the police, those who attack police and think that guns are toys must be stopped,'' the CS clarified amid a charged crowd.
CS Murkomen argued that trends encourage criminals, leading to increased violence against officers and repeated attacks on police stations. According to Murkomen, the government can no longer allow police to be sitting targets.
His directive comes at a time when police and police stations have become the latest target of goons.
During the June 25 commemorative protests on Wednesday, the Interior Ministry revealed that 300 police officers were attacked and injured.
Police stations were also looted and burned during the protests. In the latest occurrence on Thursday, a police station in Ndunyu, Nyandarua county, was torched by angry residents after a police officer allegedly shot a villager. According to Murkomen, these incidents cannot continue.

Governor Accuses Gachagua of Intimidation,"Embu Governor Cecily Mbarire has accused former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua of attempting to intimidate and coerce her to change her current political position.
Mbarire, while addressing the press on Thursday evening, criticised Gachagua for allegedly working alongside a section of Embu politicians to bring down her administration.
She also accused the former DP of reportedly attempting to manipulate Embu's political landscape by orchestrating a series of violence through the use of organised criminal gangs.
“Rigathi Gachagua, you are not God! I am not afraid of you, and I know you were behind what happened in Embu yesterday,” Mbarire commented.

She added, ""Gachagua, I will tell you, I do not care how strong you may be, but you will not intimidate me anymore, I will not remain silent anymore. If you are God, then I dare you to take my life.""
According to the governor, she received information from credible sources linking Gachagua to the violent demonstrations witnessed in Embu on June 25, which she claimed resulted in the looting of businesses and the destruction of property.
""You cannot claim to love Embu and at the same time fund thugs to destroy it. We will not accept any attempt to destroy businesses and property in Embu town again,"" Mbarire emphasised.
On the same note, she also accused Manyatta MP John Gitonga of collaborating with the former DP to destroy Embu County. She claimed that Gachagua was only using Gitonga for his selfish political gain.
Her sentiments come barely a day after a section of pro-government lawmakers linked Gachagua to the violent protests witnessed in Nairobi's Central Business District (CBD) on Wednesday, June 25.
Led by Kimilili Member of Parliament Didmus Barasa, the MPs accused the former DP of reportedly hiring goons from Central Kenya to destroy properties in the CBD.
During the press briefing, the legislators demanded Gachagua's immediate apprehension, claiming that the latter was out to overthrow President William Ruto's administration.
""We are demanding the immediate arrest of the former DP who has been on record sounding drums of war, inciting our young people against individuals who do not subscribe to his political ideology,"" Barasa claimed.

MCAs Take Action Against Senior Nairobi County Govt Official,"A storm is brewing in Nairobi County after the City's County Assembly passed a censure motion against the Chief Officer for Housing and Urban Renewal, Lydia Mathia, over her alleged role in the recent forceful evictions witnessed in the city.
The motion,  which received overwhelming support from Nairobi MCAs on Thursday, June 26, followed weeks of public outrage over what many have described as unlawful evictions that defied court orders and left scores of residents homeless.
Tabled by the Ngara MCA Chege Mwaura, the censure motion cited gross misconduct, misuse of office, and violation of constitutional rights.
The CEC is accused of heading the evictions in several estates despite an active court order blocking the process until a pending case was heard.

Affected residents from several estates in the city, including Old Ngara, New Ngara, Kariako, Buruburu, Kariobangi, Woodley, and other estates, had condemned the evictions.
The residents accused the senior county official of hiring goons to demolish homes, destroy personal belongings, and terrorise families.
“I had just left City Hall when I got a call. By the time I returned, my house had been broken into, my bags had been taken, and strangers were walking around with my clothes. I had already paid my rent, and I don't understand why this is happening,” one of the affected residents from Buruburu told a journalist during the evictions.
During the heated assembly session, MCAs slammed Mathia's office for contempt of court orders, arguing that her actions violated both Article 10(2)(a) and Article 73(1)(a) of the Constitution, which mandate adherence to national values and responsibilities of public service.
“Ms Mathia's acts and omissions constitute gross misconduct, dereliction of duty, willful disobedience of a court order,” the MCAs said.
The assembly ordered accountability, describing the evictions as a disregard for human rights. They also ordered investigations into the destruction and loss of property caused by what they described as mafia directives.
They further resolved to reinstate the tenancy of those affected. While the residents had also requested compensation, the county has yet to reveal whether they will be compensated or not.
Mathia is yet to respond to the censure motion as the Nairobi County Public Service Board is gearing up to commence disciplinary actions against her.

Angry Residents Burn Police Station Hours After Murkomen Warning,"A police station in Ndunyu, Nyandarua County, was set on fire on Thursday evening by irate residents after a police officer allegedly shot a villager.
Reports indicate that the victim, a bodaboda rider, was part of the crowd that had gone to demonstrate outside the police station over cattle theft in the area when he was shot.
The demonstrations ensued after police officers arrested three suspects believed to be behind cattle rustling in the area and placed them inside the station awaiting arraignment.
However, the angry locals demanded that the suspects be handed over to them for 'discipline'. It was during the subsequent demonstrations that an officer shot the boda boda rider.

Following the incident, the locals attacked the police post and set it on fire, even as they demanded justice for the deceased.
Videos and images shared on the internet showed the police station entirely engulfed in fire, with the residents heard cheering from a distance.
Meanwhile, the boda boda rider was rushed to the North Kinangop Hospital while in critical condition. The National Police Service is yet to issue any formal statement on the incident.
The incident comes hours after Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen issued a shoot-to-kill order against anyone who attempts to approach a police station.
Speaking to journalists moments after his press briefing on Thursday, June 26, said the order was due to the flawed justice system, where criminals arrested by police officers were later released and came back to mock those who arrested them.
He emphasised that acts of brutality against police officers and the destruction of government property would not be tolerated, adding that firearms held by officers were tools entrusted to them to uphold law and order.
""The problem that makes the police sometimes shoot down these criminals is that when these criminals are arrested, they are later released and come back to mock the officers who arrested them,"" he said.
He went on to add, ""I have said that anyone who attempts to approach a police station should be shot down. We will not tolerate people who attack police officers.""

Heartbreak for Faith Kipyegon in Paris,"There was heartbreak for Faith Kipyegon as she narrowly missed her attempt to become the first-ever woman to run a mile in less than four minutes.
Kipyegon, a triple Olympic gold medallist, needed to shave a massive 7.65 seconds off her own world record time of 4:07.64, which she set nearly two years ago during a Diamond League meet in Monaco.
In what was a star-studded occasion in Paris, the 31-year-old came incredibly close to running a sub-4-minute mile race as she clocked an impressive 4:06:42.
Despite the disappointment, Kipyegon effectively shaved more than one second from her previous record, further cementing her place as the fastest woman to run a mile in history.

Flanked by 15 pacemakers, Kipyegon started the race positively, covering the first lap with a time of 61.55 seconds.
As the race wore on, the three-time 1500m champion was well ahead of her previous record, maintaining a green light by the time she was heading to the final stretch.
At the bell for the final lap, Kipyegon clocked 3:01.84, slightly off the target pace to break the sub-4-minute barrier, but still in the green lights.
With the help of a smaller group of pacemakers to try to keep the wind at a minimum, Kipyegon gave it her all in the final lap, but ultimately just fell short.
While she appeared briefly disappointed in the seconds after the race, Kipyegon was offered support by fellow track legend Eliud Kipchoge and her team. A moment later, the disappointment turned into joy as the 1500m gem came to terms with what she had just achieved.
Speaking after the race, Kipyegon was full of optimism as she strongly suggested she would take a stab at the challenge to run the mile again.
""I feel good; I've tried. I have proven what's possible. It's only a matter of time, and I know one day a woman will run under 4 minutes. If it is not me, it will be someone else,"" she said.
""Even without these conditions, I will still go for it. I want to thank everyone who came to cheer me on. This was really special, and I am so grateful I have proved to the world that everything is possible.""

TikTok Launches New Safety Tools for Africa,"Kenya is among the countries in Africa that are set to reap from TikTok’s $2.3 million (about Ksh297 million) global mental health fund announced on Thursday.
The country, with at least 29.2  per cent of Kenyans using  TikTok according to the Communications Authority of Kenya, has been chosen among the beneficiaries of the kitty, which will sponsor locally based mental health support and prevention efforts.
In Kenya, Mental360 is the organisation that has been selected for the funding that will be directed towards supporting and developing locally relevant, evidence-based content that raises
awareness, reduces stigma, and encourages open dialogue around mental health.
TikTok is leveraging partners like Mental360 to offer assistance, including counselling, advice, free psychological support, and other essential services to those in need.

PHOTO TIKTOK
According to the social media giant, the expansion of the fund to Africa is part of a raft of changes being made to the app to promote mental health efforts.  
In the new mental health measures announced in Johannesburg, South Africa, TikTok has expanded local in-app helplines and introduced an industry-first meditation feature for all TikTok users.
All this is on top of TikTok's #MentalHealthMatters campaign, which promotes positive mental health practices.  The global gaganolt hopes that together, these efforts will support balanced digital habits, providing communities with access to reliable information.
“TikTok is committed to user safety and community well-being and provides tools and protections to help our community enjoy their experience on the platform. But to achieve this, we all need to play a very vital role in fostering a secure and respectful environment,” noted Mercy Kimaku, TikTok’s Regional Risk Prevention Lead for Sub-Saharan Africa.
These developments were announced during its inaugural Digital Well-being Summit, bringing together policymakers, mental health experts, NGOs, and industry leaders across Sub-Saharan Africa.
The summit brought together delegates from South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, and beyond to further strengthen efforts to support and protect community well-being on the platform.
“In the coming weeks, users of some countries in Africa will have access to local in-app helplines that provide expert support when reporting content related to suicide, self-harm, hate, and harassment,” TikTok said.
TikTok has also introduced a guided meditation experience tool called Sleep Hours. This is an in-app well-being resource that is automatically enabled at 22:00 for all users under the age of 18.
According to TikTok, anyone above this age can choose to turn it on. This feature, the first of its kind in the industry, was piloted in March 2025 and is available worldwide.
“People come to TikTok to learn, share their experiences, and connect with communities around the world. That’s why we’re proud to introduce tools that not only support digital well-being but also empower our community, especially young users, with a safe, supportive space to explore and navigate complex emotions,” said Valiant Richey, TikTok Global Head of Trust and Safety Outreach and Partnerships.

Quickmart Clarifies Dead Bodies Being Found in OTC,"The Quickmart supermarket has denied claims that several people were killed at one of its Nairobi CBD establishments during the June 25 protests.
In a statement on Thursday, Quickmart confirmed that two of its branches, at OTC and another one in Ruiru, had been broken into, but no casualties were reported in the fracas.
The statement came amid online reports that police were collecting bodies at their OTC branch. The reports emerged after pictures of police officers surrounding the establishment in downtown Nairobi surfaced.
With the reports, there were fears that some members of the retail chain were injured during the chaos, but the supermarket further emphasised that the security of its staff, customers, and the community at large was its top priority.

""Quickmart notes that two of our branches in OTC and Ruiru were affected during yesterday's demonstrations,"" part of the statement read.
""Contrary to misleading information circulating on digital platforms, we wish to assure the public that no staff, customers, or any other individuals were injured or deceased at the two outlets.""
As a result of the break-ins, Quickmart promised that all necessary measures to resume services were in order, calling for the support of its shoppers and staff.
In the meantime, customers of the two branches were advised to access their services at their nearest alternative Quickmart branch.
This clarification comes hours after Hanifa Adan, a popular activist, decried receiving several messages from concerned protesters near the OTC branch. 
""What’s going on at Quickmart? Goodness,"" she wrote on X, accompanied by screenshots of messages from concerned protesters.
In four of the screenshots shared, protesters relayed that they were concerned about a potential cover-up of bodies at the branch as police officers quickly dispersed them from the scene.
One such protester even claimed that at least 30 bodies were being retrieved from the premises and that they had been barred from entering.
This comes just hours after Amnesty International Kenya confirmed that at least 16 fatalities had been reported countrywide from the June 25 commemorative protests to mark the one-year anniversary of the 2024 anti-finance bill protests.

Women Senators Issue 4 Demands to Govt,"The Kenya Women Senators Association (KEWOSA) has denounced the violence meted out on girls and women during the June 25 commemorative protests yesterday.
In a statement dated June 26, the senators claimed that several women had suffered different forms of attacks, including intimate assault and molestation.
This statement comes hours after reports resurfaced on social media that several women were assaulted in the aftermath of the protests, prompting angry reactions from Kenyans.
In fact, one such attack went viral as the purported perpetrator took to X to celebrate the assault.
Goons in the Eldoret CBD on Wednesday, June 25 2025
""The women of Kenya wish to condemn, in the strongest terms, the senseless violence witnessed during the protests held on 25th June, 2025 that led to fatalities, grievous bodily harm, other injuries, rape and molestation of innocent women and girls, and arsonist attacks on businesses, government installations and key infrastructure,"" the statement read.
""We particularly decry the violence that was meted out on women and girls, including acts of sexual violence, which unfortunately are being celebrated by the perpetrators and other members of the public on social media.""
As such, the association issued four demands to four government institutions to prevent a recurrence of the same.
Firstly, they called on the State Department for Gender and the National Gender and Equality Commission to provide comprehensive support and protection to survivors, including medical and psychological support.
The Directorate of Criminal Investigations was urged to immediately and thoroughly investigate all reported incidents of sexual violence.
Subsequently, KEWOSA directed the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to ensure swift and fair prosecution of perpetrators to the fullest extent of the law.
Lastly, the women called on all their partners involved in legal and medical aid to support the victims in any way they can.
Besides the rapes, the protests also left at least 16 dead and 400 injured, a stark irony as they had been organised to celebrate the 60 victims of the 2024 anti-finance bill protests.

Token generation typically takes a few minutes or seconds; however, occasionally, Kenyans complain about problems with token generation.
Earlier this year, on Friday, February  15, Kenyans expressed their frustrations through social media after they experienced delays for hours in the generation of tokens purchased through Paybill.
According to the company, the delay, which started on Friday, February 14, was a result of technical issues.
""We are currently experiencing a delay in the generation of tokens purchased through our Paybill 888880. Our team is working to resolve the issue as soon as possible,"" Kenya Power said.

Kindiki Issues Warning After 16 Die in Protests,"Deputy President Kithure Kindiki has issued a stern warning following the deadly June 25 protests that left at least 16 people dead and over 400 injured.
Kindiki condemned the events that unfolded during the June 25 commemorative protests on Wednesday, terming it the most violent and anarchic day in the history of Kenya since the 2007/08 post-election violence.
Speaking on Thursday, Kindiki revealed that the looting, the distraction, the killings, and the chaos that were witnessed were shameful to watch, and if not controlled, they would lead the country into anarchy.
“I want to tell you that what we witnessed yesterday was the most violent and anarchic day in the history of our Country since the 2007/08 post-election violence. It was shameful. The loss of lives, destruction of public and private property, wanton looting, and destruction of private businesses were unprecedented,” Kindiki said.

The DP took the opportunity to assure Kenyans that as long as he is the country's DP, he and President William Ruto will not allow what happened on Wednesday to recur.
“On behalf of President Ruto, I want to assure you that we will not allow what happened yesterday to be repeated ever. We cannot allow our Country to slide into anarchy, lawlessness, and chaos. We will do whatever it takes to protect our Country from sliding into anarchy,” he continued.
Kindiki criticised certain religious leaders and diplomats whom he accused of encouraging young people to exercise their rights without responsibility.
“There are churches and religious organisations that advised the youth to act responsibly, but others incited them. Is what we witnessed yesterday the kind of rights they were telling the young people to exercise?” Kindiki said in a strongly worded statement.
The DP extended the same criticism to foreign envoys and political leaders, questioning whether their public endorsement of the protests was meant to provoke unrest.
Kindiki reaffirmed the government’s commitment to upholding constitutional freedoms.
“We will not interfere with the freedom of opinion, expression, or the media. But we will not allow anyone to descend on our country into mayhem,” Kindiki reaffirmed.
Kindiki, who once served as the country's Interior CS, revealed that police stations were burnt and guns and ammunition stolen, confirming that there were other hidden and ulterior intentions greater than what many people thought.
His remarks come at a time when the country is facing a growing concern about the call for accountability in police brutality.

Mass Layoff as Company Initiates Plan to Exit Kenya,"Hundreds of youths are on the verge of losing their jobs after a private company based in Nyeri initiated plans to quit the Kenyan market following yesterday's deadly protests.
Established in 2023, the company has been offering business solutions to customers by outsourcing financial and accounting tasks, staff augmentation, and data services.
While confirming the information, Senior Economic Advisor Moses Kuria on Thursday, June 26, expressed his disappointment in the firm's plan to permanently relocate from the country.
According to Kuria, in 2023, the company chose to establish itself in Nyeri due to the longstanding peace and stability in the region. The move followed the approval of President William Ruto.

He disclosed that the firm, which came into existence while he was the Trade Cabinet Secretary, had since employed over 400 young Kenyans. 
Kuria went ahead to reveal that some employees working for the firm earned up to Ksh400,000 per month in AI, Robotics, Software Development and Customer Services.
""They employ 400 young Kenyans, some earning up to Ksh400,000 per month. The company has transformed the outlook of Nyeri town,"" Kuria emphasised.
In his statement, the president's advisor expressed regret over the move, accusing a local politician of instigating violence in the region at the expense of people's jobs and businesses.
Moses Kuria's statement follows a pronouncement by the Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM), which on Thursday afternoon came out to condemn yesterday's protests, terming them regrettable.
According to the manufacturers, yesterday's demonstrations were far from peaceful and involved looting and vandalism, which caused considerable financial losses to several businesses.
In its statement on the impact of demonstrations, KAM called on the government to investigate all reported incidents of violence and ensure that perpetrators are held accountable.
""Manufacturers and business entities from various regions have reported significant damages, including looting, vandalism, injury to staff, business disruptions and destruction of property,"" read part of KAM's statement.
""This was perpetrated by individuals whose intent was not to protest but to cause harm. These acts have led to considerable financial losses to all businesses, from micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to large industries,"" the statement added.",https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/113553-400-youths-lose-jobs-after-company-intiates-plan-quit-kenya
Gachagua Responds to Calls for His Arrest,"Former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua on Thursday, June 26, issued a scathing response to calls for his arrest as he blamed the government for the mayhem that was witnessed during protests on Wednesday.
In a strongly worded statement, the former DP condemned the use of live bullets and excessive force by police officers on demonstrators, as he solely accused the state of sponsoring the chaos.
“I condemn in the strongest terms possible the use of excessive force and live bullets by the police on peaceful and unarmed Gen Z protesters,” Gachagua said in his 18-point statement.
According to Gachagua, there was a well-orchestrated plot to block protesters along Kiambu Road and Thika Road to leave them stranded while goons wreaked havoc in the Nairobi Central Business District.

Further, the Democracy for Citizens Party (DCP) leader spoke on the looting that was witnessed in the Nairobi CBD, alleging that specific businesses were targeted by design. 
""We have credible information that in Nairobi, especially the downtown region, businesses belonging to people from a certain region were clearly identified by officials from the County government of Nairobi and elsewhere. This brutal exercise was led by politicians allied to this rogue regime,"" Gachagua added.
The former DP's remarks came barely hours after Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen described the June 25 protests as terrorism disguised as dissent, as he accused the financiers of the demonstrations of a premeditated plan to overthrow the current regime.
""There was no peaceful demonstration. It was riots, chaos and anarchy, and therefore we condemn the criminal anarchists in the name of peaceful demonstrations, who unleashed a wave of violence, looting, sexual assault and destruction upon our people,"" Murkomen said.
In his speech, Murkomen revealed that the hired criminals were aiming at police officers and were also after guns in the armouries and police uniforms. He noted the criminals managed to steal firearms in two separate police stations in Kiambu County.
But Gachagua, in a rejoinder, hit back at Murkomen's remarks, accusing the CS of making allegations that are misleading and divisive.
While Murkomen was critical of political figures who endorsed the June 25 protests, Gachagua, in his statement, criticised the government for resorting to what he labelled as 'outdated tactics.' 
Gachagua, who was scheduled for media engagements on Thursday, revealed he had cancelled his media obligations in the Embu region in solidarity with those who lost their lives during the protests.

CITAM Addresses Blocking Protesters,"Christ is the Answer Ministries (CITAM) has clarified the allegation spreading online that protesters were turned away while seeking shelter at the CITAM Valley Road church during the June 25 demonstrations.
In a press statement dated June 26, CITAM Deputy Bishop Justus Mugambi said that the information was false and the church did not turn any protesters away.
The church stated that it reviewed CCTV footage and records, and there is no evidence that any person approached the premises seeking refuge on Wednesday.

CITAM said that the church had made arrangements to help those who needed assistance during the protest, but it was difficult for anyone to reach the assembly due to roadblocks.
 “We received calls from people who wanted help, and we directed them to CITAM Valley Road. We were ready for them throughout until 1:30 am, and no one came for help,” the statement reads
 “CITAM Valley Road was not easily accessible during the protests, as surrounding roads were barricaded, which made it almost impossible for a demonstrator to get to CITAM Valley Road,” part of the statement reads.
The church insisted that all CITAM assemblies always keep their doors open to those in need as part of their policies.
 “It is our policy and practice that the doors of all our CITAM assemblies remain open to anyone in need of help. We regularly assist members of the public in times of crisis, without discrimination,"" it added.
In the statement, the church added that CITAM has consistently responded to emergencies and national crises, including fire incidents.
It added that the church stands with all Kenyans for truth, justice, and unity as they work toward a more just and peaceful society
""CITAM has consistently responded to emergencies and national crises, including the Embakasi fire tragedy, the Mai Mahiu flood disaster, and drought relief efforts in various regions of the country,” Mugambi added.
