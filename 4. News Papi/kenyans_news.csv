Senator Proposes Additional Allowances for Civil Servants,"Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei has proposed an increase in hardship allowances for not only teachers but all civil servants.
Speaking while strongly opposing a government proposal to scrap hardship allowances for teachers, the senator stated that the move was necessary to cushion marginalised areas from experiencing undermined service delivery.
Appearing in the Senate, Cherargei called for the inclusion of all civil servants in the hardship allowance scheme and the expansion of designated hardship areas. He maintained that civil servants deserve fair and better compensation for working in difficult conditions.
The senator criticised a report by Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi, which alleged that Kenya would save up to Ksh6 billion if the fund were scrapped.

“Mr Speaker, this move doesn’t make sense. What will attract teachers and other civil servants to work in hardship areas like Garissa, Banisa, Todonyang, or Namanga? Mr Speaker, in fact, we should give more hardship allowances to not only teachers, but all civil servants,” the senator questioned.
According to Cherargei, the hardship allowance is not a privilege but a necessity for motivating professionals to serve in remote and underserved regions.
“We must disagree with any intention to remove hardship allowances for teachers. There is a reason we have 44 hardship zones,” the senator stated.
He further argued that more regions should be added to the list of designated hardship areas. Cherargei proposed the inclusion of several areas in Nandi County, citing Terek, Chepterwa, Kapchorwa, Sopa, Songo, Chemelit, and Chemase as regions facing challenges similar to those already recognised.
The senator warned that scrapping hardship allowances would contradict existing legal frameworks, including Legal Notice No. 534 of 1998 and Legal Notice No. 196 of 2015, which officially declared certain areas as marginalised.
He also called for the alignment of hardship allowances with the Equalisation Fund, which has allocated Ksh16.8 billion to counties in the 2025 financial year.
“You can’t build schools and hospitals without ensuring teachers and health workers are willing to serve there. Infrastructure must be matched with human resource development,” Cherargei explained.
He urged the Finance and Budget Committee to re-examine the criteria used to designate hardship areas and ensure that all deserving regions are included.
He has also called on the Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) and the Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (KUPPET) to reject any attempt to scrap hardship allowances and to remain engaged in Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) negotiations.

""When I first arrived in Kenya, I knew I was stepping into a country full of promise and deep heritage. But what I did not expect was how quickly it would feel like home,"" Dillard commented.
He went on to add, ""I have seen firsthand the strength and spirit that defined this country, whether in fostering safety and security, supporting health or business initiatives. I have been constantly reminded of the values we share.""
Dillard also expressed personal gratitude for the friendships and relationships he built while serving in Kenya, saying it was a journey of friendship, learning, and connection.
""To serve here has been more than a diplomatic assignment. To all the Kenyan friends that I have made, all the people that I have met, thank you very much,” the outgoing ambassador said.
Marc Dillard was appointed by former US President Joe Biden in December last year as a temporary replacement, shortly after the resignation of Meg Whitman.
His appointment was announced by Whitman, who revealed that Dillard would serve in a temporary capacity until President Donald Trump's administration appoints a favourable replacement.
“It has been an honour to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to Kenya for the past two years. As I depart, please join me in welcoming career diplomat Marc Dillard, who will lead the embassy as Chargé d’Affaires,” Meg Whitman announced.
On November 13, 2024, Whitman formally tendered her resignation from the ambassadorial role to Joe Biden. In her final presser as the US Ambassador to Kenya, she said it was an 'honour' and a 'privilege' to serve in the capacity.

The regulator also deregistered Masumali Meghji Insurance Brokers Limited, Nexus Insurance Brokers Limited, Online Insurance Brokers Limited, Real Alliance Insurance Brokers Limited, Solian Insurance Brokers Limited, and Swinton Insurance Brokers Limited.
According to the Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA), the brokerage firms were deregistered in line with Section 196(A) of the Insurance Act, which mandates transparency and accountability in the deregistration of insurance brokers.
The Act further requires that an insurance entity notify the Commissioner of Insurance whenever its registration is cancelled, whether voluntarily or otherwise.

“The Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA) hereby notifies the public of the de-registration of twenty insurance brokers under Section 196 of the Insurance Act,” read part of the notice.
“Under Section 196 of the Insurance Act, the insurance brokers whose names appear below have ceased transacting insurance business with effect from June 30, 2025,” the notice added.
Insurance brokers may be deregistered for various reasons, with the most common being non-compliance with the Insurance Act. Other factors include inadequate capital, mergers, or acquisitions.
Specifically, non-compliance may involve failure to remit premiums, not meeting license renewal conditions, or breaching statutory requirements as outlined in the law.

Lawyer Issues Update on MP Jayne Kihara's Arrest,"Naivasha Member of Parliament Jayne Kihara has been presented to the Milimani Law Courts awaiting charges, lawyer Ndegwa Njiru has revealed.
While issuing an update of the current events following the dramatic arrest of the MP on Thursday, Njiru alleged that the MP was taken to the Milimani Law Courts on Friday, July 18, morning at 7 am.
However, according to the lawyer, the MP was not taken inside the court, but was held in the parking lot for hours.
''She wasn’t booked at the Milimani holding cells,'' the lawyer claimed.

According to Njiru, the MP was then whisked away to an unknown location at 8:20 am, driven around, and left her lawyers stranded.
""She was at around 8:20 am whisked away in a green Subaru to an unknown destination. We are stranded,"" the lawyer alleged.
The MP, who has been livestreaming the events since her arrest, confirmed that she was taken back to the Milimani Court.
Through a livestream on her Facebook page, her lawyers, including Njiru and Kalonzo, revealed that she was still being held as officials attempted to decipher the charges they would bring against her.
In a dramatic turn of events, MP Kihara was arrested on Thursday by officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) after failing to present herself to detectives.
The detectives were seen, through the livestream, storming her house in the Maraigushu area and eventually apprehending her.
Her arrest caused tension among Kenyans and leaders. Several leaders condemned the arrest. Governor Mutahi Kahiga described the events as disheartening, particularly as they happened to a leader who had previously fought for the government.
""It is disheartening to see her being tormented by the same Government she helped put in office. For the information of the police, she is 72 years old and has to use an orthopedic belt. Treat her with care,"" the governor said.
Meanwhile, Kalonzo has stated that despite the arrest, the agenda remains the same, to ensure they remove President William Ruto from power. Kihara is an ally of former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, who has been at the forefront of efforts to decampaign the Kenya Kwanza government.

Ruto's Advisor Slammed Over Recent Controversial Comments,"The Boda Boda Safety Association of Kenya is now demanding an apology from President William Ruto's Constitutional Affairs Advisor, Makau Mutua, over his recent controversial remarks targeting the sector.
The Association, on Friday morning, criticised Mutua, terming his comments, which called for a ban on boda bodas in all major towns, not only reckless but also deeply inconsiderate.
According to the boda riders, Makau's remarks contradicted the government’s ambitious Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA), which places ordinary citizens at the centre of economic growth.
""We strongly condemn the recent statement by Prof. Makau Mutua on his social media platforms calling for the banning of all boda bodas from Kenya’s cities and towns,"" read part of a statement by the Association.

In their view, boda boda is not just a mode of transport but a lifeline for over 2 million Kenyan families who rely on the lucrative industry for daily income, food, school fees, and healthcare.
They further noted that the sector is critical, as it plays a significant role in creating employment and sustaining local economies, especially among the youth and low-income earners.
""We acknowledge there are challenges within the industry, including safety and regulation, but the solution lies in structured engagement, training, policy reform, and investment, not sweeping bans,"" the Association proposed.
""We urge all leaders, especially those in government, to uphold the principles of inclusion and empowerment, and to work with us towards solutions that uplift, not marginalise, this vital sector of our economy.""
On Thursday, Makau Mutua called for a full ban on boda bodas in major towns, accusing the sector of causing urban chaos, lawlessness, and poor road discipline.
He went on to argue that no modern city, including those in Kenya, should tolerate what he labelled as disorder, illegality, indiscipline, and poor aesthetics brought about by the sector.
""I am convinced that all boda boda should be banned from the streets of all Kenya’s major cities and towns. No modern city should tolerate such chaos, illegality, terrible aesthetics, and indiscipline on its roads,"" Mutua commented.
The advisor's remarks triggered an immediate response from a section of Kenyans, with some accusing him of attempting to undermine the sector, which significantly contributes to the country’s overall economic growth.

Govt Explains Why You're Still Listed on CRB After Paying Your Loan,"The Principal Secretary of the State Department of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Development, Susan Mang'eni, has explained that Kenyans remain on the negative list in the Credit Reference Bureau (CRB) even after settling their debts.
A CRB listing refers to a customer's credit status as recorded by a CRB in Kenya. These bureaus collect and maintain data on a customer’s borrowing and repayment behaviour from financial institutions, including banks, SACCOs, mobile lenders, and others.
Speaking during a leadership forum on Thursday, July 17, Mang’eni clarified that a CRB listing is not inherently negative, explaining that there are both negative and positive listings.
“Maybe just to clarify, CRB listing is not bad, it's just about information sharing. We have positive listings, and then we have negative listings. But then what has been happening is that the financial institutions tend to share negative, not positive,” Mang'eni explained.
PS, State Department for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Susan Mang'eni in a past event, 26 September 2024. PHOTO PS SUSAN MANG'ENI
According to the PS, once a borrower is negatively listed, the default status remains on their record for up to seven years, even if the debt has been fully repaid.
“Once you get negativity listed on CRB, you stay in that status for about seven years, in default status, even after you have paid before it is dropped off, you are still being seen as a defaulter after 7 years, then you can be cleaned up totally,” the PS continued.
The seven-year retention period is based on CRB regulations that are similar to global credit reporting standards.
Once negatively listed in CRB, Kenyans face severe consequences. Negatively listed individuals are often denied access to loans, mortgages, and other financial services.
For entrepreneurs, it can mean stalled business growth. For students, it can block education financing. And for families, it can delay home ownership.
According to Mang'eni, almost eight million Kenyans have belonged to the negative CRB listing, a situation she says follows the challenges many faced during the pandemic, drought, prolonged geopolitical tensions, among other factors.
However, the PS revealed that the Kenya Kwanza Government formed the Hustler Fund to caution Kenyans and grant them cheap loans despite their credit scores.
""Hustler Fund was to create that visibility, it was also to let the formal financial institutions to bring that practice,  for them to know that not every Kenyan is bad,"" she explained.

PSV Operators Unveil New Strategy to Evade Soaring Fuel Prices,"In the wake of the government’s move to increase fuel prices, Public Service Vehicle (PSV) operators are now turning to cheaper alternatives.
In its July review, the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) significantly hiked fuel prices, increasing the cost of Super Petrol by Ksh8.99, diesel by Ksh8.67, and kerosene by Ksh9.65.
The fuel price surge has prompted motorists to seek creative coping mechanisms, with some opting to use Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG).
According to one taxi driver, he converted his vehicle to run on LPG as a cost-effective alternative, noting that the switch has saved him a considerable amount of money in the long run.

In an interview with Citizen TV, the taxi driver revealed that LPG is cheaper per litre than petrol, allowing him to get more fuel for the same amount of money.
""I decided to convert my vehicle because if you go to the petrol station to fuel using Ksh1,000, you will be given five litres, but if you go to a gas station with the same amount, you will get eight litres of LPG,"" said the taxi driver.
""When you do the math, you will realise that you earn more money while using gas compared to petrol, because during consumption, gas takes you a longer distance than petrol,"" he added.
LPG conversions create a dual-fuel system, meaning the car can run on either petrol or gas. The system allows the driver to switch seamlessly and conveniently between the two.
The main challenge with the innovation is that refuelling with LPG has only been adopted by a few filling stations, forcing drivers to travel long distances to access viable refuelling facilities.
The latest development comes amidst outcry by motorists who have accused President William Ruto's administration of alleged exploitation, terming the increase in fuel prices as unjustified.
In a statement on July 17, the Motorists Association of Kenya (MAK) expressed its disappointment over the government's move to increase fuel prices despite a drop in oil prices in the international market.
""This abrupt hike price of Super Petrol by Kes 8.99 and Diesel 8.67 per litre on both petrol and diesel by the Ministry of Energy caught motorists completely by surprise,"" the motorists said.
""When world prices were dropping, EPRA reduced local prices by a paltry one shilling, insulting the millions of motorists who already sustain this government through oppressive taxation. Today, half the cost of fuel is made up of taxes, which is economically destructive and morally wrong,"" they added.

Mystery as CEO Dies After Alleged Forced Injection at Home,"The family of Susan Kamengere Njoki, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Founder of Toto Touch Kenya, is seeking justice following her sudden and mysterious death.
According to reports, Njoki died on July 15, just a day after she was reportedly taken forcefully from her home and injected with foreign medicine before being taken to the hospital.
Audio recordings of Njoki, in possession of KTN News, revealed that her house in Kileleshwa had been stormed by several men, who forcibly took her and injected her, allegedly under the instructions of her husband.
In the chilling audio recording, Njoki recounted how two men forcibly restrained her while two nurses injected her against her will. When she demanded to know where they were taking her, the men refused to answer, leaving her terrified and confused.

“They put me in the vehicle, and when I asked, they said they were taking me to Lavington. Why are you forcing me to take injections? Why are you forcing me to leave this place, yet you allege you are professionals?” Njoki said.
In the recording, Njoki acknowledged living with a long-term health condition, including a history of depression that had previously led to her hospitalisation for mental health challenges.
However, she emphasised that she had received treatment and was feeling well at the time of the incident.
“Tomorrow, I am scheduled for an interview with an international company. Do you think they can schedule an interview with a mad woman? Why are you trying to take me back to my past?” Njoki questioned, pointing fingers at her husband.
She placed her husband at the centre of her anguish, linking the tragic incident to a prior episode in which he allegedly insisted she remain hospitalised, even after completing treatment.
Speaking on the evening of Thursday, July 17, Njoki’s family questioned what led to her death, stating that she had been in good health and had no known medical conditions at the time.
According to Njoki’s sister, aside from the audio recording, she had also made a Facebook post about the incident, but the men forced her to delete it. The family tried to visit her in hospital, but were denied access, with approval allegedly pending from Njoki’s husband.
Shortly afterwards, they were informed of her death. The family filed a report at Kabete Police Station, prompting officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) to launch an investigation into the CEO's death.

How Detectives Arrested KNH Murder Suspect Within Hours,"Homicide detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) have arrested the prime suspect in the murder of a patient at the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH).
The suspect was arrested yesterday evening in connection with the brutal murder of Edward Maingi Ndegwa, a male patient who had been admitted to Ward 7B on July 11, 2025.
Initial reports indicate that a nurse checked on the patient on Thursday, July 17, at around 11:30 am and took his blood pressure. At 12:30 pm, a relative visited and found him stable, before leaving the ward at 1:30 pm.
However, at around 2 pm the same day, a hospital cleaner making their rounds in the corridor noticed blood oozing from the patient’s neck.

Detectives were quickly alerted and, upon arrival at the scene, traced bloody slipper prints from the victim’s bedside to a nearby toilet and eventually to a side room, where the suspect was admitted.
In the room, investigators recovered a pair of blue slippers and a blood-stained bedsheet. During the investigation, they also found a knife wrapped in gloves.
The recovered items were forwarded to the National Forensic Laboratory for detailed forensic analysis to support the case.
Preliminary investigations further revealed that the suspect had been admitted to the facility on December 1, 2024, and is also linked to the murder of another patient at the same hospital.
According to the detectives, the suspect is connected to the death of 40-year-old Gilbert Kinyua, who was killed in Ward 7C during the night of February 6–7 this year.
Following the February incident, a case file was compiled and submitted to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) for further action.
However, after reviewing the file, the ODPP directed the investigating officer to undertake further inquiries to strengthen the prosecution’s case.
Meanwhile, following his arrest yesterday evening, the suspect was taken into police custody and is currently undergoing processing pending arraignment in court.

National Treasury Officials Busted in KSh10 Million Bribery Scam,"Four employees at the National Treasury Pensions Department have found themselves in trouble with the law after being implicated in a bribery syndicate targeting members of the public.
The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) confirmed the arrests on Thursday, July 17, following a two-month undercover operation by the commission.
According to the EACC, the operation was triggered by numerous complaints from members of the public, who reported facing frustration from the Pensions Department whenever they sought services.
Preliminary investigations uncovered a well-coordinated criminal network within the department, where officers are alleged to have engaged in extorting bribes from the public in exchange for faster services.

Among the suspects under investigation are two senior pension officers, a chief clerical officer, and an intern.
The EACC further revealed that members of the public were reportedly required to pay money through a mobile money paybill account in exchange for the expedited processing of their requests.
Investigations revealed that a total of Ksh10.5 million had been transacted through the paybill, which was registered under the name of the intern’s mother.
""In the last two years, a total of Kes10,523,044 has been transacted through the paybill account, with the above suspects receiving various amounts. Further investigation reveals that the said paybill account is registered in the name of Mr Muhando's mother,"" the EACC revealed in its report.
The four suspects have since been processed at the Integrity Centre Police Station and are expected to be transferred to Kilimani Police Station pending further investigations.
This is the latest case of the EACC cracking down on malpractice within a government institution, with the new tactic involving sting operations seemingly paying dividends. In April, two officials from the Kakamega Civil Registration Department were arrested for allegedly soliciting and receiving bribes from applicants seeking civil registration documents.
Like the National Treasury suspects, the duo, a Civil Registrar stationed at the Kakamega Huduma Centre and a Civil Registration Officer, are alleged to have solicited bribes to speed up service delivery.
A separate incident in March saw EACC officials catch a government official working with the Lands Control Board red-handed, receiving a Ksh70,000 bribe.

AU Addresses Summit Targeting Youth for Ambassadorial Roles,"The African Union Commission (AUC) has issued a public warning disowning an event allegedly aimed at recruiting young Africans for ambassadorial roles.
In a statement released through its Department of Education, Science, Technology and Innovation, the AUC clarified that the summit and its associated Country Ambassador application form were illegitimate.
The Commission further stated that no such application was developed, approved, or disseminated through any of the AUC’s official websites or social media platforms.
""The African Union Commission categorically states that it has not organised the purported Summit and neither has this form, the website, and their contents been developed, approved, or disseminated by the  African Union,"" AUC's statement read.
Notably, AUC's warning came after a number of professionals and students reported coming across online advertisements inviting them to apply for ""Country ambassador"" roles for the 'summit'.

The flagged application form entices unsuspecting users with a lead question that states, “Do you have what it takes to represent the AU Strategic Objectives (CESA AU 25–34) in your country?”
It goes on to state that selected ambassadors would be tasked with promoting the AU's 12 strategic objectives, engaging stakeholders, mobilising schools, and helping to plan the summit.
The same form promises several benefits to successful applicants, including an official certificate of appointment, a continental ambassador recognition certificate (upon meeting targets), and the opportunity to attend the summit fully sponsored, including air tickets and accommodation.
The post further alleged that the summit would be held annually in different African cities over the next decade, while promising ambassadorships to individuals who achieve their set goals.
However, the AU dismissed the claims, advising stakeholders in Kenya and across Africa to avoid interactions with the unauthorised platform, which requires one to share personal details.
""We advise all stakeholders, including youth, educators, and prospective applicants, to exercise extreme caution and refrain from sharing personal information or engaging with unauthorised platforms misrepresenting themselves as being associated with the African Union,"" the statement went on. 
AU, while distancing itself from the event, also warned that unauthorised use of its name, logo, or any references to its staff constituted a violation of its intellectual property and institutional integrity.

Another Patient Killed Inside KNH Ward,"Another patient has reportedly been killed at the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), raising fresh concerns about patient safety at the country’s largest referral hospital.
According to reports from the authorities, the 52-year-old male patient was found dead on his bed in Ward Seven. Witnesses stated that the patient was physically disabled.
Security agencies, led by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), have camped at the hospital to determine what exactly transpired and who was responsible for the patient’s death.
In a statement issued hours after the incident, KNH CEO William Sigilai confirmed on Thursday, June 17, that the patient was found dead after visiting hours, at around 2 pm.

""We are deeply saddened to confirm an incident regarding the tragic death of a patient at Kenyatta National Hospital. On the afternoon of July 17, 2025, at around 2 pm, immediately after visiting hours, a patient was discovered in a medical ward in blood-soaked beddings. The patient was examined and certified dead,"" the CEO stated.
""The matter has since been reported to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and other government security agencies. Our thoughts and prayers are with the patient's family during this difficult time,"" he added.
While extending its condolences to the family, the hospital assured Kenyans of its commitment to safety and stated that it would provide updates as more information became available. about the incident
The incident marks the second time this year that a patient has been murdered at the hospital under unclear circumstances.
In February, another patient was found murdered inside the hospital after being fatally stabbed by an unknown individual on the night of Thursday, February 6.
Initial reports blamed the incident on a security lapse, claiming that an unidentified individual entered Ward Seven and fatally stabbed the patient with a kitchen knife.
""We are deeply saddened to confirm an incident involving the tragic death of a patient at the Kenyatta National Hospital,"" the CEO said.
""The hospital is working closely with law enforcement authorities and has launched an internal investigation to determine the facts surrounding this incident,"" he added.

Police Commission Breaks Silence on Alleged Rift With IG Kanja,"The National Police Service Commission (NPSC) has denied claims of a rift with the National Police Service (NPS) regarding the management of human resource functions.
In a statement on Thursday, July 17, the NPSC clarified that the purported standoff was based on misunderstandings linked to past audit queries and not the current state of affairs within the police service.
According to the NPSC, the issues predate September 2024, when Douglas Kanja began his tenure as Inspector General of Police.
""The Commission wishes to clarify that the audit matters under discussion pertain to the financial year 2022/2023, which was prior to the appointment of the current Inspector General of Police, Mr Douglas Kanja,"" a statement from the NPSC said.
NPSC CEO Peter Leley appearing in Parliament, July 16, 2025. PHOTO NPS
The clarification came after the NPSC appeared before the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC) to respond to concerns raised by the Office of the Auditor-General regarding financial accounts for the year ending June 30, 2023.
Speaking during a session with the National Assembly’s Public Accounts Committee on Wednesday, July 16, NPSC CEO Peter Leley told the committee that the Commission had been unable to audit the police payroll, raising accountability concerns about whether its decisions on recruitment and staffing had been implemented.
“We are static in accessing the payroll for purposes of auditing, the payroll to ascertain whether the decision of the commission have been complied with,” Leley said.
However, in their statement, the NPSC emphasised that since Kanja took office, there has been a “cordial and collaborative working relationship” with the Commission, enabling the seamless execution of each agency's constitutional mandate.
“There has not been any strained relationship with the Service under Mr Kanja’s stewardship,” the statement added.
Incidentally, the commission's response came barely 24 hours after media reports suggesting that IG Kanja had blocked access to the police payroll, effectively hampering audit efforts by the NPSC.
Further reports indicated that the commission raised concerns with parliament, raising alarm over obstruction and lack of cooperation from the NPS in reviewing salary-related documents. These claims fuelled speculation of underlying friction between the NPS and NPSC.
These claims have since been refuted by the NPSC, who insist the alleged 'turf war' between the two agencies did not reflect the current reality.

Kenyan Marathon World Record Holder Suspended,"The Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) has provisionally suspended marathon record holder Ruth Chepng'etich after she tested positive for prohibited substances.
In a statement on Thursday, July 17, the AIU stated that samples collected on March 14 showed the presence of Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ).
According to AIU Head Brett Clothier, Chepng'etich was later notified of the results and interviewed in person by the unit on April 16, where she complied with requests regarding the investigation.
Clothier added that three days after the interview, on April 19, Chepng'etich voluntarily opted for the provisional suspension while investigations into her case were ongoing.

""A Notice of Charge has been issued against Chepng’etich regarding the detection of the Prohibited Substance – a diuretic – following an investigation into the Kenyan athlete’s positive test, which was reported to the AIU on 3 April this year, at an estimated concentration of 3800 ng/mL in urine,"" the AIU stated.
""Presenting a brief chronology of this case, AIU Head Brett Clothier revealed Chepng’etich was 'notified and interviewed in person by the AIU in Kenya on 16 April and complied with requests regarding our investigation',"" it added.
According to the AIU, the athlete has the right to have her case heard before a disciplinary tribunal.
The suspension comes 10 months after the 30-year-old made history by winning in a world record time of 2:09:57 at the Chicago Marathon in October last year.
Chepng’etich, who won the Chicago Marathon for the third consecutive time, broke the previous world record of 2:11:53, which had been set by Ethiopian Tigst Assefa at the 2023 Berlin Marathon.
""I feel so great. I am very proud of myself and I've done well for the victory and the world record,"" Chepng’etich said after her win.
""This is my dream that has come true. I fight a lot thinking about the world record. I am very grateful,"" she added.
The suspension comes just three months after AIU also confirmed a two-year ban on Kenyan marathoner Purity Changwony after she tested positive for two banned substances, Norandrosterone and Triamcinolone Acetonide.

Police Intercept Suspect With Truckload of Stolen SGR Equipment,"Police have apprehended a suspect who is said to have been transporting stolen Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) railway materials in Kibini area, Kajiado County, using a lorry.
In a statement on Thursday, July 17, the National Police Service (NPS) confirmed that the suspect was intercepted following a tip-off.
The railway materials included 61 railway sleepers and 60 rail bars, according to the officers. The operation was spearheaded by officers from the Critical Infrastructure Protection Unit (CIPU) and police from the Sultam Hamud Police post.
""Today, 17 July 2025 – Officers from the Critical Infrastructure Protection Unit (CIPU), working collaboratively with colleagues from the Sultan Hamud Police Post, acted on a tip-off and intercepted a lorry suspected of transporting stolen railway materials in the Kibini area,"" NPS stated.

""Upon inspection at Sultan Hamud Police Post, the vehicle was found to be carrying 61 railway sleepers and 60 rail bars, suspected to have been vandalised from the railway line,"" It added.
The National Police Service (NPS) has confirmed that security agencies have launched investigations into the matter, and the suspect is awaiting arraignment in court.
""NPS commends the officers for their swift action and reiterates its commitment to protecting critical infrastructure and bringing vandals to justice,"" it stated.
In Kenya, any person caught vandalising railway infrastructure is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for life.
In a statement issued in December 2024, the Kenya Railways Corporation cautioned Kenyans against vandalising railway infrastructure, stressing that such actions pose a great risk to passengers.
The Corporation urged members of the public to remain vigilant and report cases of vandalism to law enforcement immediately.
""We wish to notify the public that vandalism of railway property is a crime punishable by law. The safety of our passengers is of paramount importance to us,” Kenya Railways said.
During his time as the Interior Cabinet Secretary, Deputy President Kithure Kindiki announced that acts of vandalism of railway infrastructure would be treated as acts of terror.

MP Livestreams DCI Raid at Her Home Before Arrest,"Naivasha Member of Parliament Jane Kihara has been arrested by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) after failing to present herself to detectives following allegations of incitement and undermining a public officer.
In a dramatic event, which she livestreamed on her Facebook account on Thursday, July 17, detectives were seen storming her house in the Maraigushu area and eventually apprehending her.
""Dozens of police officers are currently at my Maraigushu home to arrest me,"" she said in her Facebook account moments before being arrested.
She was taken to Naivasha Police Station to record a statement and later transported to the DCI headquarters on Kiambu Road, Nairobi.

Minutes after her arrest, the lawmaker, an ally of former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, claimed she was not aware of the charges that led to her apprehension and that the move was politically motivated.
""There is nothing, they are just telling me that I might have investigations that may aid in investigations, which I really don't know what they are talking about, and the information they are seeking,"" she stated.
""The summons is said to have come from Nairobi, and the director is waiting for me there. So we will go there and see what happens,"" she added.
According to a letter issued earlier this week by the Assistant Inspector General of Police, George Lenny Kisaka, the lawmaker was under investigation for disseminating statements that contravened Section 132 of the Penal Code, which criminalises undermining the authority of public officers.
The letter claimed that security agencies have reasons to believe that the lawmaker is directly connected to the alleged offence or possesses crucial information that can aid ongoing investigations.
“I have reasons to believe that you, Hon. Jayne Njeri Wanjiku Kihara, MP Naivasha Constituency, are connected to the offence or have information that can assist me in my investigations,” the letter read.
Kihara had been ordered to present herself before officers at the DCI Headquarters, on Kiambu Road, on Monday, July 14, 2025, at 10:30 am. The notice cautioned that she would be liable to prosecution if she failed to present herself on the stipulated date. 
Responding to the letter, Kihara accused the government of using state agencies to intimidate and silence critics. 
“The days of intimidating leaders using the criminal justice system are long gone. Summoning me to DCI headquarters tomorrow will not change Kenyans’ resolve because it’s not about Jayne Kihara but about our country, Kenya,” Kihara said.

Trailblazing Kenyan Feminist & MP Phoebe Asiyo Dies at 92,"Kenya has been plunged into mourning after the death of Phoebe Muga Asiyo, the pioneer of the Maendeleo ya Wanawake movement.
Asiyo's passing was confirmed by her family in a statement, which revealed that the icon had passed away peacefully in her sleep while in North Carolina, U.S.
“With heavy hearts, the Asiyo family shares the profound loss of our cherished mother, Hon. Dr. Phoebe Muga Asiyo… Her presence and love will be deeply missed by all who knew her,” the family statement read in part.
A bold advocate for women’s rights, Asiyo became a Member of Parliament for Karachuonyo in 1982, becoming one of the few women in Kenyan history to achieve such a feat at the time.

She is largely remembered as the original voice behind the push for gender equality laws, more specifically, the two-thirds gender principle, which was eventually incorporated into the 2010 constitution.
Long before women's rights went mainstream, Asiyo was already vocal in championing fair representation and the inclusion of women in leadership positions.
Her advocacy journey is intertwined with the oldest and most influential women's organisation, Maendeleo ya Wanawake, where she held key leadership roles in the group, which served as a platform for nurturing women leaders.
Through Maendeleo ya Wanawake, Asiyo used her growing influence in the group to lay the foundation for various women's movements in the country.
Away from Parliament,  Asiyo served as Kenya’s representative to the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women and was heavily involved in international conversations around gender equality, peace, and development.
Because of her push for Kenyan women's rights, her voice carried the message across borders, further elevating Kenya's profile on issues affecting women.
In her twilight years, Asiyo was a key voice in national reconciliation and peace-building efforts, especially during and after Kenya’s political transitions, which have been tense in recent elections. 
Among the first leaders to mourn Asiyo was Homa Bay governor Gladys Wanga, who described the late Asiyo as a beacon and 'mentor to many'. 
""Mama Phoebe Asiyo was not just a leader; she was the steady hand that lifted others, the voice that spoke for the voiceless, and the unwavering spirit that refused to accept injustice,"" Governor Wanga stated.

MMFs vs SACCOs: Where Should You Put Your Money in 2025 and Beyond?,"As more Kenyans look for ways to grow their money outside of traditional banking, SACCOs and Money Market Funds have emerged as two reliable options. But how do you decide which one suits you best?
Kenyans.co.ke spoke to Jeremiah Odera, a financial expert who has been in the industry for over eight years and has been investing with the traditional banks, SACCOs, and MMFs to give us a detailed insight into how the three operate. 
Understanding the Basics
SACCOs are member-owned cooperatives that offer savings and loans at affordable rates. Members pool their resources to provide credit to one another. On the other hand, MMFs are unit trusts that invest in short-term, low-risk financial instruments like Treasury bills, commercial paper, and bank deposits.
MMFs typically offer an annual net return of 8–11 per cent, depending on the fund manager and market performance. These returns are calculated daily and compounded monthly. SACCOs, meanwhile, pay dividends and interest on deposits, often ranging between 8–10 per cent annually, based on the SACCO’s profitability and policies.
Liquidity and Access to Funds
MMFs provide high liquidity—most allow withdrawals within 24 to 72 hours. This makes them suitable for short-term goals and emergency funds. SACCOs, however, often have limited withdrawal options, as deposits are intended to build long-term savings and qualify for loans.
An image illustratin money saving tips GOODHOUSEKEEPING
According to Odera, generally, if one is considering both a future investment scheme and a wealth-building plan, then SACCOs offer the ideal investment destination.
""If you are looking to build wealth, then SACCOs are the ideal investment destinations. MMFs, on the other hand, are good but ideal for quick money; what is referred to [as] a high liquidity option. This means that in MMFs you can easily get back money, but with SACCOs you have to save for some duration, usually three to five years, to be considered for loans,"" Odera said.
Loan Accessibility
SACCOs shine when it comes to borrowing. Members can access loans at relatively low interest rates, typically 8 per annum, after a few years of saving. MMFs do not offer credit facilities, making them less ideal if you're also looking to borrow.
MMFs, however, depend on the interest rates they offer, which are tied to key economic factors such as the stability of the shilling, and the Central Bank of Kenya sets base lending rates. 
''In as much as MMFs have fluctuations in rates, with SACCOs, just be assured that the rates can never go down. The beauty is that you earn dividends on your investments, you are simply a shareholder in a SACCO,’’ Odera added.

When it comes to savings, some SACCOs offer to buy out existing bank loans for their members. The advantage is that you then repay the loan at the SACCO's interest rates, which are often lower than those charged by banks.
Risk and Regulation
MMFs are regulated by the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) and managed by licensed fund managers. They are generally considered safe, though not risk-free. SACCOs are regulated by SASRA (SACCO Societies Regulatory Authority), but risk varies depending on the SACCO's governance and financial health.
Experts advise that you shop around for the best SACCO with no historical cases of governance and management issues.
Charges
MMFs may have minimal management fees that slightly impact returns, but these are generally low. SACCOs, on the other hand, may charge membership, maintenance, and loan processing fees, though experts note that SACCO loan processing fees are often lower than those of traditional banks.
If you are considering a loan, SACCOs are usually a better option than banks due to their favourable interest rates, especially if you have consistent savings and a reasonable repayment period.
Consider joining a SACCO if you are looking for affordable loans, value a community-based financial model, and are committed to regular saving.
Expert Tip: Diversify
Experts advise that you do not have to choose just one savings point. Savvy savers should split their funds, putting part into MMFs for liquidity and part into SACCOs for long-term financial planning and loan access.
Both SACCOs and MMFs offer valuable benefits depending on your financial goals. Understanding their differences in structure, returns, accessibility, and risk can help you make an informed decision and grow your wealth with confidence.
Odera, however, advises that one should study the market carefully, along with the various factors that influence it.
""The shilling has been fairly stable against the dollar for the last eight months, and ideally, this is the best time to try the MMFs,"" Odera pointed out.
""In summary, it is good to create what is referred to as a portfolio in finance. It is good to have your money across the different investment and savings schemes; they often become handy.""

MPs Grill CA Boss Over Media Blackout During Demos,"Members of Parliament from the Public Investment Committee have warned the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA's) Director General, David Mugonyi, against pushing Kenya towards anarchy after a recent directive ordering the shutdown of televisions.
The CA elicited tensions in the country after ordering all radio and TV stations to stop livestreaming the June 25 protests. The CA went further to shut down several stations that continued streaming.
The directive elicited tensions in the country as questions built up on media freedom.
During the session that took place on Thursday, July 17, MPs led by the chairperson, Caleb Amisi, grilled Mugonyi over the legality and implications of the blackout, warning that such actions risk undermining Kenya’s democratic foundations.

“If we are going to look for a loophole to move out of that law, we are still going back to anarchy. Do not become an agent of anarchy. It will be bad for this country,” warned MP Amisi.
The June 25 directive in question cited alleged violations of Articles 33(2) and 34(1) of the Constitution, as well as Section 461 of the Kenya Information and Communications Act. In the notice, CA Director-General David Mugonyi warned broadcasters that failure to comply would result in regulatory action, including possible license suspension.
However, Members of Parliament challenged the Authority, accusing it of overstepping its mandate.
“Do not become an agent of anarchy. It may feel comfortable for you now, but the repercussions for this country will be felt for years to come,” Amisi reiterated.
The committee maintained that any regulation of the media must be anchored in the law and follow due process, not be based on arbitrary or punitive directives.
“Rwanda went down with just a click of a rogue person in the media. Countries have collapsed because one person followed unlawful orders from another rogue leader,” the committee noted.
Echoing Amisi’s sentiments, another member emphasised that Kenya had made significant democratic progress that must not be undone.
“Let us not destroy what we’ve built. We want a better Kenya today and tomorrow. Let the media be responsible, yes, but let you also be responsible. Let all of us be responsible so that whatever we do today is protected tomorrow,” the MP added.
On his part, Mugonyi defended the move, maintaining that the CA was acting on its rightful mandate as stipulated in the constitution.
“I would say the CA is guided by the Constitution and rightfully put Article 33 and 34 of the Constitution of Kenya. We are also guided by the Kenya Information and Communication Act, Section 461, on issues at hand when the media is to be limited,” Mugonyi maintained.

Police Officer Found Dead by Roadside,"Investigations have been launched into the gruesome killing of a police officer, whose body was found dumped by the roadside in Rarieda, Siaya County.
According to an official report obtained by Kenyans.co.ke., the lifeless body of the police constable was discovered along the Ndori–Luanda Kotieno road, near Rarieda Secondary School.
What was more puzzling was the fact that the officer's body was discovered just two kilometres from the police station where he was reportedly posted.
The body's discovery was made by another officer in the wee hours of Thursday morning. The officer reported the matter, prompting a response team led by Rarieda Sub-County Police Commander and detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) Rarieda, who immediately launched a probe.

At the time the body was discovered, there were clear signs of foul play, with the late officer bearing deep cut wounds consistent with a violent attack.
A TVS motorcycle, believed to have been in his possession at the time of the incident, was found next to the body.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the deceased had earlier escorted a colleague and a third individual. On his way back to a popular shopping centre, the officer's motorbike reportedly ran out of fuel, prompting him to call for assistance.
The colleague who responded to the distress call arrived at the scene only to find the officer dead, with fatal head wounds.
The body has since been moved to Lwak Mission Hospital Mortuary, pending a postmortem examination to determine the exact cause of death.
Incidents of homicides where law enforcers are the victims have risen in recent months, with the Rarieda ordeal coming just weeks after suspected thugs shot an officer dead in Thika.
The officer, who was in plain clothes, is believed to have been shot after a routine inspection of motorcycles turned violent.
A separate incident in June also saw a police officer in Nakuru County killed, while two others were wounded after an ambush by an armed gang while on patrol on Sunday night.

He has also since been recognised by Politrack Africa as the best MP in Kenya in their 2025 Star Leaders Awards.
The African Golden Award stated that the MP's mix of activism, education, and political influence on the citizens made him rank the top leader across the continent.

"Govt Official, Police Summoned Over Missing CCTV in Likoni Ferry Tragedy","Three top officials, including a Managing Director have been summoned by a Mombasa court for questioning over the handling of CCTV footage tied to the 2019 Likoni Ferry tragedy.
On Thursday, July 17, Mombasa Law Courts Chief Magistrate Alex Ithuku directed Kenya Ferry Services(KFS) boss, the Likoni Sub-county Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) head, and a senior investigating officer to appear in court on July 24, 2025.
The directive came amid mounting concerns over missing or incomplete video evidence which had the potential to shed more light on the 2019 incident which saw 35-year-old Mariam Kighenda and her 4-year-old daughter drown after their car plunged into the Indian Ocean.
At the time, rescuers took 13 days to retrieve the bodies of mother and daughter who were found in a tight embrace, in an incident which caused nationwide outrage.
A trailer plunged into the Indian Ocean at the Likoni crossing channel on Wednesday, January 13 FILE
Principal Prosecution Counsel Alex Ndiema asked the chief magistrate to compel the officials to explain the chain of custody for the CCTV footage.
This is amid allegations that the footage was handed to KFS management instead of being properly submitted as official evidence.
While the investigating officer presented a short clip showing the vehicle slipping into the Indian Ocean during the hearing, the video was ruled incomplete since it failed to show the whole events which led to the plunge.
Due to the gap in evidence, the judge expressed concern about the legality and thoroughness of the investigation. Further, the court noted that the original, unedited footage was never availed, raising suspicion about how the case was being handled.
The court also heard that a former lead investigator in the case bypassed formal protocols by turning over the raw footage believed to contain the whole sequence of events, to KFS management.
According to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP), the missing footage is now being considered a key piece of evidence in determining whether the tragedy was as a result of negligence or lapses in procedure.
In the years since the tragedy, fresh evidence has emerged, with two officials from the KFS admitting in 2022 that the ferry that claimed the lives of Kaghenda and her daughter was faulty.
An engineer with KFS told Mombasa Chief Magistrate Martha Mutuku in 2022 that all blame fell on the faulty prow that failed to provide sufficient buoyancy for the ferry.

CS Mbadi Warns IEBC Over Election Budget,"Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi has warned the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) against reckless spending of its budget ahead of the upcoming planned by-elections.
While speaking before a Parliamentary committee on Thursday, July 17, Mbadi urged the Commission to utilise its budget amounting to billions of shillings, wisely, ahead of the over 20 pending by-elections and upcoming 2027 General Elections.
CS Mbadi revealed that oversight would be conducted on the IEBC over the use of its budget, warning that dire consequences awaited the electoral body if investigations revealed misappropriation of the funds.
“Even IEBC, we are going to ask questions. They are things that you buy and do not dispose of immediately. Why do you buy them in every election cycle?” Mbadi posited regarding the procurement of biometric kits.

“Even ballot boxes, these things, even if they look a bit old, who is fighting with them? Why must they be bought every election? A lot of savings can be realised,” he added.
In February, the IEBC Deputy Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Obadiah Keitany revealed that Ksh61 billion would be needed to finance the upcoming 2027 General Elections.  
Appearing before a National Assembly Committee, Keitany confirmed the figure, adding that the commission would register an additional 5.7 million Kenyans as voters. This would bring the total figure of registered voters to 28 million.
The money would be used for a variety of activities, ranging from boundary delimitation, kit replacement, allowances, ballot paper transport, and other miscellaneous costs.
For boundary delimitation, Keitany informed the committee that the Commission’s budget was Ksh7 billion but this was still a matter that needed advice from the courts. 
At the time, the Commission added that 14 by-elections were still pending, with a projected cost of Ksh480 million needed to conduct the mini-polls.
IEBC Finance Director Osman Ibrahim also stated that 45,352 Kenya Integrated Election Management System (KIEMS) kits, which IEBC needs to electronically capture voters’ facial images, fingerprints, and civil data, would need replacing.
Even as he assured that his ministry would disburse adequate funds on time, Mbadi noted that the operational costs were still too high and called for austerity in the electoral body’s operations.
He added that the government would ensure that elections are conducted on time, assuring that all the necessary support would be given to the IEBC. 
“We will run our elections in 2027 within the time required, and I do not think there will be any hitch,” he stated.

State Gives Update on 70KM Road Construction Within Nairobi,"President William Ruto has revealed that the government is in the process of establishing a 70-kilometre road network across Nairobi.
Speaking in Embakasi on Thursday, July 17, the head of State claimed that the roads will be essential in easing traffic across the city, which will in turn catalyse economic metamorphosis within the country's capital.
According to the president, the project, which is being executed in phases, is part of the government's strategy to also see the modernization of the city and position it as a prominent global hub.
""We have rolled out a comprehensive plan that will change the face of Nairobi to make it a top global hub,"" Ruto said.

""In the first phase, we are constructing at least 70 kilometres of roads within the city to facilitate trade, ease traffic, and spur growth,"" he added.
Furthermore, the president said that the government is in the process of rehabilitating several key roads that are damaged to enhance mobility in the city.
The announcement by Ruto comes two days after the Kenyan National Highways Authority (KeNHA) revealed that it is in the process of expanding Kiambu Road from a two-lane single carriageway to a four-lane dual carriageway in a bid to ease traffic at the busy road.
In a notice on Tuesday, July 15, the Authority said that it has received a Ksh38.7 billion loan from the China Export-Import (EXIM) Bank , which will facilitate the expansion of the road.
According to KeNHA, the road will be expanded from  Pangani Estate in Nairobi County through Muthaiga and then end at Ndumberi in Kiambu County.
According to KeNHA, the highway will include two-lane service roads on both sides and pedestrian walkways along the entire route, as well as new bridges.
""The Government of Kenya has received commitment from China through the China Export Import Bank to finance the cost of the Capacity Enhancement of Pangani–Muthaig –Kiambu–Ndumberi (B32) Road,""  the notice stated.
""The project will be implemented through FIDIC Silver Book – Engineering, Procurement and Construction Contract Arrangements,""  it added.

Protests Erupt Over Shooting of Security Guard,"Private security guards in Nairobi staged a protest on Thursday, July 17, demanding justice after their colleague was tragically shot and killed while on duty. The incident occurred during the volatile nationwide protests on June 25.
The guards gathered en masse at the property where Fred Wamale was shot.
Wamale was shot at about 4:30 pm on June 25, while positioned at the entrance of the company's building. His employer confirmed the fatal shooting occurred as he performed his duties amidst widespread demonstrations on that day.
The protesting guards insisted on a thorough investigation into Wamale's death and expressed fears for their own safety in similar future situations.

This latest incident highlights the precarious position of private security guards, who often find themselves on the front lines during protests with limited defensive capabilities. 
The incident came on a day marked by renewed protests nationwide as thousands took to the streets in remembrance of the deadly June 25, 2024, anti-finance bill demonstrations.
In a statement released on June 25, Wamale's host company extended condolences to his family and colleagues as they confirmed that he was shot at the entrance of their office building.
""We are deeply saddened to report that Mr Fred Wamale, a security guard stationed at our headquarters, was fatally shot at the entrance of the building at 4:30 pm this evening during the ongoing protest,"" they said. 
Wamale was rushed to Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital but was sadly pronounced dead upon arrival in the hospital.
The family of Wamale, led by his widow, Merceline Otieno Kesa, also demanded justice and transparency.
A post-mortem was done, and it was confirmed that the bullet entered his abdomen and pierced his spine.
The colleagues and family said that they deserve clear answers, demanding individuals involved in the shootings be arrested.

Malala Reveals When Gachagua's DCP Party Will Be Launched,"The Democracy for Citizens Party (DCP) Deputy Party Leader, Cleophas Malala, has revealed that the much-anticipated party launch will be held immediately after the party leader, Rigathi Gachagua, returns from his trip to the United States.
Speaking to Standard Digital on Thursday, July 17, the former Kakamega Senator said that the party launch would be held in about three months.
“We were waiting for the political temperatures to calm down, but immediately our party leader comes back from the US, DCP will be finally launched. Within three months, we will have launched our party,” Malala said.
However, Malala failed to reveal the venue or the tentative date, claiming that further details on the launch would be unveiled soon.

In a subsequent press briefing, Malala and other DCP officials confirmed that the party would be fielding candidates in the upcoming by-elections across the country.
This comes weeks after its highly anticipated launch on June 3 was postponed after the party was denied access to Kasarani Stadium, where it had planned to hold its national launch.
Gachagua is currently on a two-month trip to the US, where he is on a mission to popularise the party through city hall meetings across several states. The trip is expected to end in August.
Malala further explained that he had been left out of the US trip so that he could hold the fort back in the country to ensure party activities continued to run smoothly.
Since announcing the party on May 15, DCP has faced a series of unfortunate events regarding its launch, which Gachagua had announced would be open to all Kenyans.
Originally, it had been slated for June 3 at Kasarani Stadium, but the party’s Nairobi Patron, Irungu Nyakera, announced its cancellation just a day before the launch.
""The DCP party launch that was to be held on Thika Road has been called off, awaiting a new venue and date,"" Nyakera stated on June 2.
While speaking during an engagement with the Maa community on June 23, Gachagua claimed that he would be launching the party on July 7 in Maa land if they were to provide a private space, citing the likelihood of goons being sent to disrupt the event.
“I wanted to have the party launch in Nairobi, but they declined,"" Gachagua said. “I want to ask you, if you will allow, to allow the event to take place in Maa land.”
The party’s deputy leader confirmed this assertion during a TV interview, but it would not come to pass, as the day coincided with the eventful Saba Saba protests that left at least 38 dead.
This came just days after posters circulated online claiming that the party would be launching during the June 25 commemorative protests. The party later dismissed the claims as fake.

Ruto’s Advisor Wants Boda Bodas Banned from All Major Towns,"President William Ruto's Senior Advisor on Constitutional Affairs, Makau Mutua, has called for the complete removal of boda bodas from all major cities and towns across the country.
In a statement issued on Thursday, July 17, Mutua has described the presence of boda bodas in all major cities and towns as the main source of chaos within these cities.
He further alleged that these boda bodas destroy the aesthetics of the cities and towns, terming it necessary to have them removed.
''I am convinced that ALL boda boda should be banned from the streets of ALL Kenya’s major cities and towns.  No modern city should tolerate such chaos, illegality, terrible aesthetics, and indiscipline on its roads.  Absolutely Unacceptable,'' Mutua alleged.

Boda bodas are the most popular form of transport in the country, especially in cities like Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, and Eldoret. They offer fast, affordable transport and are often the only option in congested or underserved areas.
However, they have numerously been linked to rising cases of road accidents, crime, and traffic violations.
Mutua's sentiments elicited a heated debate among a section of Kenyans. In response to his sentiments, some Kenyans agreed with the advisor's opinions while others strongly disagreed.
This is not the first time a senior leader has called for the regulation of boda bodas on the roads in the country. In May, Central Organisation of Trade Unions (COTU) Secretary General Francis Atwoli made similar calls.
Speaking during the Labor Day celebrations, Atwoli called for the regulation of the boda bodas; however, his main focus was on Nairobi City, with an additional focus on hawkers and matatus.
According to Atwoli, boda bodas, matatus and hawkers in the city depicted the county and country at large as poor.
''This city must reflect other cities of the world like Accra, Abuja, Abidjan, and Kigali. We cannot remain in a filthy city, a city filled with hawkers, riders, and matatus. When somebody arrives at the JKIA airport on Mombasa Road is full of hawkers, depicting the picture of the poverty of Kenya,"" Atwoli said.
Meanwhile, boda bodas have remained a lifeline for many Kenyan youths who use it as a form of self-employment to earn an income.

Govt Unveils Special Loans for Select Students,"The government has unveiled a targeted student loan programme aimed specifically at students pursuing forestry studies.
The new loan facility was announced on Thursday, July 17, following the signing of a service contract between the Kenya Forest Service (KFS) and the Higher Education Loans Board (HELB) to establish the Kenya Forestry College Student Funding Scheme (KFC-SF).
Signed at the KFS headquarters in Karura, the Kenya Forestry College Student Funding Scheme (KFC-SF) seeks to offer tailored financial assistance to students enrolled in forestry-related courses at the Kenya Forestry College (KFC) through loans and bursaries.
Clement Ng’oriareng of KFS and HELB CEO Geoffrey Monari formalised the agreement on Thursday, with Ng’oriareng describing the contract as a critical step towards building a workforce that can support Kenya's forestry and environmental protection goals.

He also emphasised the growing demand for green careers and the need for the country to invest in talent capable of managing Kenya's natural resources in a sustainable way.
While the scheme will be fully administered by HELB, it will be subject to strategic oversight from a tripartite committee comprising members from KFS, HELB, and the Kenya Forestry College.
This structure, according to the KFS, is a deliberate design to ensure that funding is efficient and aligns with the government's forestry goals.
Kenyan universities have introduced a range of forestry-related academic programmes as the push for environmental conservation gains momentum globally.
One of the most common programmes is a Bachelor of Science in Forestry, which covers key areas such as forest ecology, silviculture, forest management, and forest policy.
A Bachelor of Science in Agroforestry and Rural Development is another popular course, focusing on integrating trees into farming systems and supporting sustainable livelihoods.
The new partnership comes at a time when HELB was grappling with financial challenges, with CEO Charles Ringera confirming a significant financial shortfall for student loans this year.
HELB reportedly received Ksh26 billion for the 2025/2026 financial year, far short of the Ksh48 billion the board says is needed to provide loans to students from low-income households pursuing higher education.

Inside Structure of the IEBC and Why it Matters in Elections,"A central pillar of Kenya's democracy, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) is a body often misunderstood yet perpetually under the microscope. Tasked with the monumental responsibility of delivering free, fair, and credible elections, its structure, processes, and independence are under constant scrutiny. But what exactly is its anatomy, how is it designed to navigate the complexities of electoral management, and what are the crucial tasks that define its mission?
The IEBC's very genesis lies in a painful chapter of Kenya's history. Established on November 9, 2011, through the provisions of the 2010 Constitution (Article 88) and the IEBC Act, 2011, it emerged from the ashes of past electoral controversies. It specifically replaced the Interim Independent Electoral Commission (IIEC), which itself was a transitional body formed after the widespread dissatisfaction and violence that followed the disputed 2007 General Election. The formation of the IEBC was, therefore, a cornerstone reform, designed to instill independence and restore public confidence in Kenya's electoral processes.
At its core, the IEBC's mandate is comprehensive, spanning the entire electoral cycle. From the initial stages of voter registration to the final tallying of results, the Commission is constitutionally empowered to oversee every aspect. Its key functions include the continuous registration of voters, the critical task of delimiting electoral boundaries, regulating the intricate affairs of political parties, settling pre-election disputes, and meticulously registering candidates vying for various elective offices. 
Beyond the mechanics of voting, the IEBC is also charged with public voter education, facilitating election observation, enforcing campaign finance regulations, and upholding a robust electoral code of conduct.

The decision-making and oversight body of the IEBC comprises a Chairperson and six Commissioners. These individuals are selected through a rigorous, public recruitment process conducted by an independent IEBC Selection Panel, ensuring a degree of transparency in their appointment. The current team is led by Chairperson Erastus Ethekon, who recently took over the mantle, inheriting a role previously held by figures like the late Wafula Chebukati, whose tenure was marked by immense pressure and significant legal battles.
Chairperson Ethekon, alongside Commissioners Ann Njeri Nderitu, Moses Alutalala Mukhwana, Mary Karen Sorobit, Hassan Noor Hassan, Francis Odhiambo Aduol, and Fahima Araphat Abdallah, were sworn into office recently. Their non-renewable six-year term immediately thrust them into the heart of Kenya's political landscape, with their most immediate and significant challenge being the oversight of the upcoming 2027 General Election.
This reality was not lost on Ethekon, whose first words after his swearing-in underscored his commitment: ""My first loyalty is to Kenyans,"" he affirmed, pledging to ensure a peaceful and credible electoral process.
Critical to the delivery of fair elections are two particularly complex and often contentious functions: voter registration and electoral boundary delimitation. The IEBC is responsible for maintaining a clean and accurate voters' register through continuous registration, as well as periodic cleanups. This ongoing process involves removing deceased voters, correcting erroneous entries, and updating voter details to reflect changes in residence or status, all aimed at safeguarding the principle of ""one person, one vote.""
IEBC & Voter Registration
Voter registration is a multi-faceted process carried out at various gazetted centers across the country. These include permanent IEBC county and constituency offices, temporary registration centers deployed during mass registration drives, and even integrated service points like Huduma Centres. For Kenyans living abroad, the process extends to selected Kenyan missions, ensuring diaspora participation. 
At the heart of this process is the Biometric Voter Registration (BVR) system, which captures an applicant's alphanumeric data alongside unique biometric features such as fingerprints and facial images, which are then used for verification.
Upon successful registration, applicants receive a laminated acknowledgement slip as proof of their entry into the system. This slip, while not a requirement for voting itself, confirms their registration status and the polling station where they are expected to cast their ballot. 
Following any major registration drive, the IEBC publishes a provisional voter register, allowing citizens a crucial period to verify their details online or physically. This verification window also serves as an opportunity for the public to raise objections to any incorrect entries, ensuring the final register used on election day is as accurate and transparent as possible.

IEBC & Boundary Review
Beyond voter registration, the IEBC's mandate includes the intricate and often politically charged process of electoral boundary review, commonly known as delimitation. The core purpose of this exercise is to define or redefine the geographical limits of constituencies, which elect Members of the National Assembly, and county assembly wards, which elect Members of County Assemblies. This function is vital for ensuring equitable representation across the diverse regions of Kenya.
The Constitution provides clear directives for these reviews. Constituencies, currently fixed at 290, must be reviewed at intervals of not less than eight years and not more than twelve years. The last delimitation was done in 2012.
Crucially, any changes must be completed and gazetted at least twelve months before a general election to prevent disruptions and ensure stability. However, with less than three years remaining until the 2027 polls, the clock is ticking for the IEBC to embark on and conclude any meaningful adjustments to the current boundaries.
The boundary delimitation process relies heavily on the latest enumerated national census figures, such as the 2019 data, which forms the primary basis for determining the ""population quota."" This quota is calculated by dividing Kenya's total population by the fixed number of constituencies (290) or the determined number of wards, providing an average population size for each electoral unit. 
While population is key, the Constitution allows for strategic deviations: cities and sparsely populated areas can deviate by up to 40 percent from the average, while other areas are permitted a 30 percent variance.
Beyond numerical quotas, the IEBC considers several qualitative factors during delimitation. These include geographical features like mountains or rivers, the distinction between urban and rural areas, the preservation of ""communities of interest"" (shared cultural, historical, or economic ties), and the existing means of communication and infrastructure. Based on this comprehensive data analysis, the IEBC prepares a preliminary report outlining proposed new names and boundaries, indicating potential mergers, splits, or significant alterations to existing units.
A crucial stage in this process is public participation. The IEBC is constitutionally mandated to notify the public of the review and publish the preliminary report for a minimum of 30 days. During this period, extensive public hearings are conducted nationwide, allowing individuals, community groups, civil society organizations, and political parties to submit memoranda and make oral representations.
Following public input, the IEBC reviews all submissions and makes necessary revisions to its preliminary report within a specified timeframe, typically 14 days. The revised report is then submitted to the relevant Parliamentary Committee for its advisory recommendations. It is important to emphasize that while Parliament offers input, the ultimate and final decision on boundary delimitation rests squarely with the IEBC. 
The final report, detailing the new boundaries, is subsequently published in the Kenya Gazette, though the new boundaries only formally take effect upon the dissolution of Parliament following their gazettment.

The IEBC Secretariat
Underpinning the entire operational framework of the IEBC is its professional Secretariat, headed by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), currently Marjan Hussein Marjan. This administrative and technical arm, comprising nine Directorates, 17 departments, two Deputy Commission Secretaries, and a vast network of County Election Managers (CEMs) and Constituency Election Coordinators (CECs), is the engine that translates the Commissioners' policies into action. 
The Secretariat manages all day-to-day operations, including procurement, logistics, human resources, and the deployment of electoral materials and personnel. During general elections, the CEO serves as the National Returning Officer for the Presidential Election, with CEMs and CECs acting as Returning Officers for their respective regions.
All things considered, the IEBC, through its policy-setting Commissioners and the diligent execution of its Secretariat, is the lynchpin for ensuring that Kenya's elections are conducted professionally, transparently, and credibly, reflecting the will of its people.

Ruto Issues Orders to Kanja During Nairobi Tour,"President William Ruto has ordered the immediate withdrawal of police officers stationed at a contested piece of land in Baba Dogo, Nairobi.
Speaking on Thursday during the launch of the Climate WorkX: Rehabilitating the Nairobi River programme, the President directed Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja and Nairobi Regional Commander George Seda to ensure the officers leave the area without delay.
“I heard there are police officers deployed on that land. I want to direct that they immediately vacate the premises. That land belongs to the public, and this directive should be implemented with immediate effect,” Ruto stated.
The Head of State strongly criticised the unnamed private developer accused of attempting to illegally take over the land, warning that the government would not tolerate such actions.

Further, Ruto promised the residents of the affected area that the government will construct a stadium on the piece of land to help develop local talents and ensure effective utilisation of the property. 
“We will come to construct a stadium on that piece of land,” he said, reiterating the government’s commitment to protecting public property from illegal encroachment.
“To the developer who wants to grab that land, be warned, three things are waiting for you. Stop immediately or prepare to face us head-on. This will not be entertained,” the President added.
The ownership of the contested land has been the subject of a dispute, with the developer claiming rightful ownership of the property over the past few months.
On Wednesday, tensions escalated after a standoff broke out between police officers and members of the public. Most of the officers, clad in anti-riot gear, had been deployed to oversee the planned demolition and takeover of the land.
However, hundreds of youth defied orders to vacate and instead remained on the grounds, staging a peaceful resistance.
Videos and images obtained by Kenyans.co.ke showed the youth playing football and engaging in other recreational activities on the pitch, seemingly unfazed by the heavy police presence.
The officers, unable to act due to the defiant crowd, watched from a distance as bulldozers stood by awaiting clearance to begin demolitions.
Despite the heightened tension, no demolition took place, and the operation was halted.
