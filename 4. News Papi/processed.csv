hello java,"Here's a simple ""Hello, Java!"" program explained step by step:

```java
public class HelloJava {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(""Hello, Java!"");
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
1. `public class HelloJava`: Defines a public class named `HelloJava` (filename must be `HelloJava.java`)
2. `public static void main(String[] args)`: Entry point where Java starts execution
3. `System.out.println`: Prints the text to standard output
4. `""Hello, Java!""`: The string literal to be printed

**To run:**
1. Save as `HelloJava.java`
2. Compile: `javac HelloJava.java` (creates `HelloJava.class`)
3. Execute: `java HelloJava`

**Output:**
```
Hello, Java!
```

**Key concepts:**
- Java is case-sensitive
- Every application requires a `main` method
- Statements end with semicolons (`;`)
- Code blocks use curly braces (`{}`)
- `System.out.println` adds a newline after printing

tango tango 1 2 1 2,"The given phrase ""tango tango 1 2 1 2"" can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Word Analysis**:
   - The word **""tango""** appears **twice** (repeated consecutively).

2. **Number Sequence**:
   - The numbers **""1""** and **""2""** each appear **twice**, forming an alternating pattern: **1, 2, 1, 2**.

**Final Breakdown**:
```
tango: 2 occurrences  
1: 2 occurrences  
2: 2 occurrences  
```

**Pattern Insight**:  
The sequence alternates between two distinct elements:  
- A dual repetition of ""tango"" (mirroring a dance rhythm).  
- A looping numeric pattern ""1, 2"" repeated twice (suggesting a cyclical count).

This could represent a rhythmic structure (e.g., dance steps paired with beats)."
