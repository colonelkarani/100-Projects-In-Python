State Crackdown on Section of Businesses Begins,State Crackdown on Section of Businesses Begins as businesses start entering the market...,"The Ministry of Water, Sanitation, and Irrigation has announced a crackdown on unregistered and rogue water drillers across the country.
In a statement on Wednesday, June 18, the ministry affirmed that the weeding out of these businesses will be pivotal in restoring professionalism, integrity, and accountability in borehole drilling in the country. 
The ministry further revealed that it will reinforce regulations in the sector to ensure that every driller in the country firmly adheres to the set standards and environmental best practices.
Additionally, the ministry stressed that upholding the recommended drilling practices will safeguard the well-being of people and industries that heavily rely on groundwater.

The announcement was made after the Principal Secretary for Water and Sanitation, Julius Korir, held a meeting with the Rig Drillers Association of Kenya to deliberate on how the government can expand water accessibility in the country.
""The PS assured members that the Ministry is committed to convening all relevant stakeholders to weed out unscrupulous and unregistered drillers, safeguarding the industry and protecting communities relying on groundwater resources,"" the ministry stated. 
Drilling a borehole is an essential activity in many parts of Kenya, especially in areas where access to clean and reliable water is limited. However, for one to kickstart a borehole drilling business, one must adhere to legal requirements and necessary permits to ensure that the operation is legal.
For one to become a borehole driller in Kenya, one must have several permits and licenses, including a hydrogeological survey report, an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) from the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA), and a Water Resources Authority (WRA) permit.
According to WRA, which is the regulatory body for water resources in Kenya, unlicensed borehole drillers risk significant penalties, including fines of up to Ksh1 million or a jail term of up to two years.
The announcement comes three months after the Water Services Regulatory Board (WASREB) directed all the small-scale water service providers to register with the board.
In a notice issued by the board on Tuesday, March 18 the registration of these businesspeople, who include community water projects, gated community water providers, private or individual water operators, and public benefit or non-governmental organisation (NGO) water projects, is in line with the Water Act 2016, which mandates that all water service providers must be licensed.
“Section 85(1) of the Water Act 2016 provides that a person shall not provide water services unless under the authority of a licence issued by the Water Services Regulatory Board (WASREB). Pursuant to this section, notice is hereby given to all water service system operators who supply water services in all 47 counties in Kenya to register their operations with WASREB,” the notice read.

JOHNSON SAKAJA","The Ministry of Water, Sanitation, and Irrigation has announced a crackdown on unregistered and rogue water drillers across the country. The national government has taken action to address issues in the water drilling sector, focusing on unlicensed and irregular operators. This initiative is aimed at promoting professionalism, integrity, and accountability within the industry by enforcing stricter regulations. By doing so, it aims to protect communities reliant on water resources and ensure that all businesses comply with legal requirements.  

The announcement was made after Principal Secretary Julius Korir held a meeting with the Rig Drillers Association of Kenya (RDAK) to discuss expanding access to water in Kenya. The meeting highlighted the need for the government to expand water availability, particularly in underserved areas.  

The intervention is expected to impact several sectors, including borehole drilling, which is essential for water supply in many parts of Kenya. Businesses operating in these areas must adhere to legal standards and environmental best practices to remain compliant with regulations.  

According to Water Resources Authority (WRA), unlicensed water drillers face significant penalties, such as fines up to Ksh1 million or potential jail terms of two years. This measures are designed to uphold the recommended drilling practices and protect water resources from exploitation.  

The announcement comes three months after the Water Services Regulatory Board (WSAREB) mandated that all small-scale water service providers register with the board. The notice aligns registration requirements with the Water Act 2016, which requires licenses for water service operations.  

The RDAK's notice was issued in January 2025 and involved activities such as cleanup exercises by community water projects in Nairobi. These actions underscore the government's commitment to addressing water-related challenges while ensuring transparency and accountability in the sector.","[Scenic River Flowing Past A City - Main Scene: A serene river flowing past a bustling city, water wells standing tall as symbols of sustainability.]

Protests Against Sakaja Erupt After Goons Wreak Havoc in CBD,Protests About Sakaja Spill Shock In a New Area,"Several Kenyans took to the streets at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) on Wednesday, June 18, to protest, demanding the resignation of Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja.
This is after Governor Sakaja was allegedly linked to the goons who attacked protesters during the demonstration on Tuesday, June 17.
In the video seen by Kenyans.co.ke, a group of residents were seen marching outside the hospital chanting, ‘Sakaja must go.’
The protesters also demanded justice for those injured in the demonstration that took place yesterday, leaving scores injured and property destroyed.

While it remains unclear where the group begun its march, the nearly a hundred people camped at the Kenyatta National Hospital where d Boniface Kariuki, a 22-year-old hawker who was shot by a police officer at the Central Business District during the height of the protests is being treated.
KNH confirmed that 16 people who were injured are receiving treatments, and Kariuki, is now in critical condition in KNH's intensive care unit.
William Sigilai, KNH CEO, speaking to the press earlier, stated that an object believed to be a rubber bullet was removed from the left side of Kariuki's head.
Sakaja has faced criticism after being tied to goons who were seen walking with sticks and brutalising protesters. The goons were also captured on camera breaking into shops, robbing goods and destroying others.
The goons were seen chanting and marching through the streets, chanting Sakaja's name, saying, 'Sakaja, we have defended the city.'
Sakaja, however, denied any role in hiring or organising any goons, stating that he was away with his team during the demonstrations.
“We categorically dissociate ourselves from any gangs, militias, or politically sponsored groups that exploit demonstrations to engage in criminal activity,” Sakaja stated
Embakasi East MP, Babu Owino, had earlier accused Sakaja of hiring goons, terming it as acts of organised terror disguised under the cover of anti-street protests.
""Johnson Sakaja, your actions did not make you strong. Hurting others does not give you power; it only reveals your utter disregard for the rule of law,"" Owino said.

Police Send Plea to CBD Shop Owners After Laptop Looting Spree,"1. ""Ladies & gentlemen, we gather with a plea from our beloved CBD Shop Owners; the investigation has been heightened with a recent laptop theft incident.""  
2. ""FBI investigation highlights increased suspicion at U.S. Air Force pilots' scene. Heightened suspicion leads to potential charges and legacy impact.""  
3. ""Investigation into driver's death is ongoing, leading to charges against U.S. Air Force pilots. This extends the legacy of their mission.","The National Police Service (NPS) has called on shop owners within Nairobi's Central Business District (CBD) whose premises were broken into and laptops stolen to visit the Central Police Station.
In a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Police Spokesperson Muchiri Nyaga stated that four laptops were found by police officers during yesterday's protests in Nairobi.
Muchiri revealed that the laptops were recovered following the arrest of a suspect who is allegedly linked to a gang of criminals accused of stealing from shop owners during the protests.
""NPS wishes to clarify that following recent protests in Nairobi, several shops were broken into and various items were stolen. Police officers arrested one suspect and recovered four laptops, which are now in safe custody,"" he revealed.

""We therefore urge anyone whose premises were broken into and had laptops stolen to visit the station to identify the recovered items,"" Muchiri added.
According to the police boss, the police have since launched investigations to identify and arrest those involved in criminal activities during yesterday's protests.
The police were forced to address the matter after a video depicting a police officer holding laptops during yesterday's demonstrations went viral on social media.
In the footage, the officer was captured rushing towards a police van, which was on standby. He then handed them over to another officer who was waiting inside the vehicle.
The police car, which had other officers inside, sped off, prompting a series of mixed reactions from Kenyans, with some questioning where they were taking the devices.
The recovery of the laptops from thieves was part of a series of events witnessed during yesterday's protests. The most notable and tragic incident was the shooting of Boniface Kariuki, a face mask vendor who was gunned down along Moi Avenue.
However, the police service on Tuesday evening issued a statement, stating that the rogue officer who shot Kairuki in the neck had been arrested.
In its press statement, NPS also distanced itself from a group of goons who were spotted armed with crude weapons loitering within the CBD. ""The Service takes great exception and does not condone such unlawful groupings,"" Muchiri Nyaga said.

Sakaja Responds to Claims of Sponsoring Nairobi Goons,Sakaja responds... challenges teams,"Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja has denied sponsoring goons who infiltrated protests and unleashed the mayhem witnessed in Nairobi’s Central Business District (CBD) on Tuesday.
In a statement released on Wednesday, Sakaja, while denying the claims, condemned the act by club-wielding goons to destroy property and rob Kenyans, adding that the goons were not from his county.
“We categorically dissociate ourselves from any gangs, militias, or politically sponsored groups that exploit demonstrations to engage in criminal activity,” Sakaja stated.
“We strongly condemn the destruction of public and private property witnessed last week, perpetrated by hired goons brought in from outside Nairobi,” he added.

His comments come after a section of leaders led by Embakasi East Member of Parliament Babu Owino linked him to the goons, accusing him of orchestrating the chaos witnessed in the capital by sponsoring the goons. 
The outspoken legislator claimed the attacks were carried out with the backing of senior government officials, terming the acts as organised terror disguised under the cover of anti-street protests.
In his scathing remarks, Owino lashed out at the governor, saying, ""Johnson Sakaja, your actions did not make you strong. Hurting others does not give you power; it only reveals your utter disregard for the rule of law.""
Aside from Owino, rumours spread online like a bushfire especially after a video showing club-wielding men passing outside Governor Sakaja's office shouting, ""We protected the city Skaja.""
In addition, in the clips that surfaced online, the alleged goons could be heard chanting in support of Sakaja, leading some to believe that the governor was connected to the goons.
During the protests, motorbikes ferrying suspected goons rode into town with the occupants shouting that there would be no protests in the city.
Armed with crude weapons, including knives and clubs, they went after protestors and other civilians in the CBD, snatching handbags, phones, and any other valuables they could get hold of.
In some videos shared on social media, the alleged goons were seen supposedly working in tandem with the anti-riot police officers to disperse the crowds.
Sakaja has urged the National Police Service (NPS) to move with haste and identify, arrest, and prosecute all those responsible for acts of violence, vandalism, and theft. 
“This is critical, not only to deliver justice to those affected, but also to prevent further escalation, especially by citizens feeling compelled to take the law into their own hands,” he argued.

The claims have been fueled by a section of leaders led by Babu Owino, who accused Sakaja of orchestrating the chaos caused by sponsored goons during the protests. Their comments were met with suspicion as they linked his actions to anti-street demonstration efforts.

Parliament Summons CS Murkomen,Parliament Encludes CSMurkomen,"Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen has been summoned to appear before the National Assembly next Wednesday amid mounting pressure following the death of blogger Albert Ojwang.
National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang'ula issued the directive on Wednesday, June 18, during a tense parliamentary session that centred around police conduct.
Three MPs, Kabondo Kasipul MP Eve Obara, Manyatta MP Gitonga Mukunji and Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo, were particularly vocal against Murkomen, whom they accused of failing to do enough to ensure accountability of top security officials.
In response to the MPs demands, Wetang'ula summoned Murkomen for a fresh grilling session in a week's time, on Wednesday, June 25.

“More importantly, I direct that the Minister for Internal Security appear before this House on Wednesday afternoon so that those with questions raised be availed to him,” Wetang’ula said. 
“This is so that we can have this House lend its strong voice on matters that we disapprove of, on the conduct of officers who are supposed to protect wananchi,” the speaker asserted. 
Murkomen came under fire in the House on Wednesday, with the Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo specifically pointing to events of the past week as pointers to indicate a need for radical reforms in the police service.
''I would suggest that to ask our colleague to bring better answers is to ask him for a task that is beyond him because he is relying on the very same officers who claimed Ojwang died by suicide,'' the lawmaker said.
Amollo went a step further by urging the formation of an ad hoc committee, which would in independently look into the death of the blogger and get dissolved once its mandate was fulfilled.
Wetang'ula opposed this move, saying the only way to set up a committee would be through a motion -  and this would further delay the opportunity to grill the Interior CS. 
Since Ojwang's death, Murkomen has come under immense pressure to restore sanity in the police force. To ensure accountability, the CS directed all police stations across the country to have CCTV cameras installed. 
He also directed that all instances of assault or misconduct within stations be reported within an hour, with the CCTV systems expected to play a central role
Adding to these changes, Murkomen announced a community-focused integration plan to improve public trust and service delivery. He revealed that police operations will undergo regular independent audits to assess effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. High-performing officers and stations will be publicly recognised and rewarded.
Despite the promising reforms, the police service came under scrutiny once again on Tuesday, June 17, after a video of a police officer shooting a hawker from point-blank range during protests surfaced. While Murkomen is yet to publicly address the issue, the National Police Service has since confirmed the identity of the two officers involved in the life-threatening altercation. 
Meanwhile, the case involving Ojwang's death is still shrouded in uncertainty - something which has pushed MPs to call for more urgent action.
As of Wednesday, Trial Magistrate Benmark Ekhubi ordered Central Police Station OCS Samson Talaam to be detained for 15 days pending investigations. The Prosecution and IPOA team had on Monday applied to be given 21 days, citing the complexity of the exercise.

Ruto Calls High-Level Retreat Amid Fresh Round of Protests,Pushes for Retreats Amid Fresh Protests!,"President William Ruto is set to lead the Executive arm of government during the upcoming two-day National Executive Retreat, which will focus on the country’s slowing economy and the rate of employment.
The retreat, comprising Ruto, his Deputy, Kithure Kindiki, Cabinet Secretaries, Principal Secretaries, and senior government officials, will commence on Thursday, June 19, and run until Friday, June 20.
The high-level engagement comes at a time when the country faced a fresh round of protests, akin to those witnessed last year during the anti-Finance Bill demonstrations. 
Kenyans, mostly in the Nairobi Central Business District (CBD), protested against the killing of popular influencer Albert Ojwang. The demonstrations turned violent, with goons infiltrating the protests and police shooting a mask hawker at point-blank range.

Even so, according to Secretary to the Cabinet Mercy Wanjau, the retreat will serve as an opportunity for the Executive to conduct its midterm review.
“The 3rd upcoming National Executive Retreat will provide a moment to take stock of progress, evaluate impact, and make informed decisions about the path ahead,” Wanjau noted in a statement.
“The question of the moment will be: what difference have our efforts made in the lives of Kenyans, and where should efforts be recast to enhance delivery?” she posited.
Consequently, Wanjau seemingly intimated that the retreat will address the state of employment in the country, which she described as having been recorded as “below target”.
She cited the 2025 Economic Survey report, which revealed that the labour market recovery was slower than expected, especially for the youth, who make up the bulk of Kenyans, and other vulnerable groups. “This remains an area of concern and a call to action.”
In addition, the economy is expected to be another key area of concern during the retreat. Wanjau noted that the country’s fiscal position was under pressure, hampering the government’s ability to deliver on its programmes.
Once again, she referenced the survey, disclosing that it provided insight into areas where ambitions were yet to be fully realised.
“It reminds us that while meaningful progress is underway, the journey towards lasting transformation continues,” she stated.
Aside from the two critical issues, it remains to be seen whether Ruto will address the shooting of Boniface Kariuki, the mask hawker, and the planned protests of Wednesday, June 25, in honour of Gen Zs who lost their lives during last year’s skirmishes.

MoH Gives Update on Contraceptives in Kenya,"Kenya has issued new information on contraceptive methods, offering crucial guidance to improve sexual health management.","The government has confirmed that it has received 186,072 family planning commodities, funded by the United Kingdom, which will be distributed across the country.
The commodities, which were received by the Medical Services Principal Secretary, Ouma Olunga, at the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (KEMSA) headquarters on Wednesday, June 18, include 16,272 sets of Levoplant, 69,800 doses of DMPA-SC, and 100,000 sets of Jadelle.
According to Ouma, the commodities will be critical in averting over 131,000 unintended pregnancies, reducing unsafe abortions, and reducing contraceptive stockouts in healthcare facilities.
The PS confirmed that the commodities were funded through the United Kingdom's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) and procured through the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).

“On behalf of the Ministry of Health, I extend our sincere gratitude to FCDO and UNFPA for their commitment to strengthening Kenya’s reproductive health services,” the PS said.
“These commodities will enhance contraceptive security across health facilities, reduce the risk of stockouts, and strengthen the reproductive health system. It is estimated that this donation will help avert over 131,000 unintended pregnancies, reduce unsafe abortions, and ultimately save lives,” he added.
Modern contraceptive use in Kenya has grown significantly over the years, with more women adopting family planning methods to manage and prevent unintended pregnancies.
According to the Ministry, the use of these commodities not only empowers individuals to plan their futures well but also contributes significantly to the country’s social and economic well-being.
“Access to voluntary contraception empowers individuals to make informed decisions, reduces maternal and child mortality, and enhances economic stability by enabling families to plan their future,” Olunga said.
However, despite the majority of people viewing the use of contraceptives positively, some Kenyans have voiced opposition. For instance, Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale, speaking during a Senate proceeding on Thursday, May 16, alleged that contraceptives are being used as a tool to control Africa’s population.
Khalwale claimed that there is an urgent need for public awareness to ensure that the general public is well cognisant of their impacts and their effects.
''Contraception by way of modern methods is foreign to us, the owners of those methods, who had an original intention of controlling the population of black Africa. Therefore, as we allow our women access to these contraceptives, we must accompany it with adequate education,'' the senator claimed.

KNH Details State of Shot Hawker & 15 Other Protest Casualties,KNH Details State of Shot Hawker & 15 Other casualties in Hong Kong,"Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) CEO William Sigilai has confirmed that the hawker shot by a police officer during Tuesday's protests underwent surgery at the facility.
Speaking during a press conference on Wednesday, Dr Sigilai confirmed that the hawker received emergency surgery at the hospital, during which an object believed to be a bullet was removed from the left side of his head. He was subsequently taken to the Intensive Care Unit, where he remains.
However, he could not confirm whether the object was a live bullet or a rubber bullet, stating that all objects removed from all casualties had been taken for further analysis.
""Usually, when we remove foreign bodies from the bodies of injured persons, they are submitted for analysis, and that is what we will establish. I can only say that we suspect it was rubber, but we are not experts in that field,"" he stated.

Besides the hawker, the hospital confirmed that 15 others, totalling 16 casualties, were rushed to the hospital's emergency wing as a result of the protests.

Govt Proposes Changes in How Protests Are Held,Introducing Cutting-Edge Changes in How Protests Are Conducted,"The Government Spokesperson, Isaac Mwaura, has proposed the designation of specific public spaces where people can conduct their protests.
In a statement on Wednesday, June 18, Mwaura claimed that Parliament should engineer a law to restrict demonstrations in certain areas, in order to prevent the destruction of property and violence, which he said undermines the infrastructural and economic progress the country has made over the years.
During protests, according to Mwaura, the public should refrain from engaging in violence by provoking security officers or destroying property, acts he claims not only compromise the spirit of genuine protests but also endanger the lives of other civilians.
""Let us be clear: violence from any side is unacceptable. Our democracy gives room for dissent, but not disorder, and disobedience. We must resist the temptation to respond to wrongs with further wrongs,"" Mwaura said.

""To this end, Parliament is encouraged to put in place an enabling legislation that safeguards the right to picket in a peaceable manner by designating public spaces for such endeavours, while ensuring that other citizens can go about their lawful business without obstruction. This is how a mature democracy balances rights with responsibilities,"" he added.
Additionally, Mwaura claimed that politicians should not take advantage of the tension in the country to incite violence or settle political scores. The spokesman stressed the need for all political, civil society, and community leaders to be at the vanguard in advocating for peace.
""At this time, settling political scores at the expense of public peace is not only irresponsible but also dangerous. True leadership demands responsibility and commitment to God and Country,"" he said.
Responding to the incident where police officers harassed and allegedly shot Bonface Mwangi Kariuki, a mask vendor, in the head during protests near Cabral Street in Nairobi, Mwaura urged the public to remain calm, as the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) conducts investigations into the incident.
Kariuki is recuperating at the Kenyatta National Hospital. Preliminary reports indicate that the victim was shot using a rubber bullet, causing damage to the upper part of his body, in particular the head.
The two police officers involved in the shooting of the vendor have been identified as Masinde Baraza and Duncan Kiprono from Kileleshwa Police Station and are currently in police custody at Capitol Hill.
""The Government has noted with concern an incident in which a police officer is alleged to have shot a civilian. We are encouraged to report that our fellow citizen is recuperating well in the hospital. Such actions are unacceptable, and the Government is committed to thorough investigations by the IPOA. Justice must be served and accountability will be pursued as per the provisions of the law,"" he said.
According to the Kenyatta National Hospital, in a statement on Wednesday, June 18, apart from Kariuki, a total of 16 patients were received at the hospital with gunshot and blunt force injuries.

PHOTO AFRICA UNCENSORED","The Government spokesperson, Isaac Mwaura, has proposed designating specific public spaces where citizens can conduct protests, ensuring they avoid inciting violence or causing property destruction. During protests, individuals must refrain from engaging in unlawful acts to prevent disrupting infrastructure and hindering economic progress. According to Mwaura, violence is unacceptable, as it undermines democracy by eroding the spirit of genuine dissent while endangering civilians' lives.

To address this, Parliament is encouraged to implement an enabling legislation that designates spaces for peaceful protests while allowing others to function lawfully. This balanced approach ensures a mature democracy. Additionally, politicians should avoid using tension to incite violence or manipulate political outcomes. Mwaura emphasized the importance of leaders being at the forefront of peace-making efforts.

In a July 18 press briefing, Mwura urged citizens to remain calm during events involving police officers, highlighting that true leadership demands responsibility and commitment to the country's sacredness. Police officers involved in a recent incident were identified as Masinde Baraza and Duncan Kiprono from Kileleshwa Police Station, currently in custody at Capitol Hill.

A Kenyatta National Hospital statement on June 18 reported that 16 patients were admitted due to gunshot and blunt force injuries. In a protest involving Kariuki, police engaged the protesters, who later recovered.

"Kenyans to Get Compensation for Shark, Whale & Stingray Injuries","Kenyans to Receive Compensation for Potential Marine Disasters Due to Shark, Whale & St stingray Injuries","Kenyans living near water bodies will henceforth be eligible for government compensation in case of physical attacks from certain aquatic animals.
This is after the National Assembly passed the Wildlife Conservation and Management (Amendment) Bill, which sought to include sharks, stone fish, whales, and sting rays among the wildlife species whose attacks leading to death and injuries could necessitate compensation.
The bill, sponsored by Lamu East MP Ruweida Obo, seeks to ensure that individuals living near water bodies are entitled to compensation in cases of death or injury caused by specific wildlife species.
Previously, the compensation list only covered crocodiles in cases of human injury or death, and hippos in cases of property damage.

Only attacks by eight animals leading to injuries or death necessitated compensation: elephants, lions, leopards, rhinos, hyenas, crocodiles, cheetahs, and buffalo.
In cases where animal attacks led to damage to crops, livestock, or other property, six more animals were added to the list, bringing the number to 14.
These animals included hippos, zebras, elands, snakes, and wild dogs. The new list brings the total to 18.
This regulatory update comes at a pivotal time, as the Kenyan government has begun implementing a new system to aid in the prompt compensation of human-wildlife conflict victims.
On May 13, the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) released a statement informing Kenyans how they could lay claims in the event of such attacks.
The KWS Director General, Erustus Kanga, urged victims of human-wildlife conflicts and their families to report the cases as soon as they occur to enable the government to process compensation claims quickly.
""The cases can be reported at KWS offices or at the State Department of Wildlife, which manages the compensation process and allocates funds based on verified claims from victims of wildlife attacks or damages,"" he stated.
This came as the government intensified efforts to address the rising incidents of wildlife-related deaths, injuries and loss of property, in a countrywide campaign that ended in Meru County.

PHOTO MIANO","Kenyans will now receive compensation in case of attacks by shark, whale, and stingray near water bodies, following a significant wildlife conservation update. The Kenyan government introduced an amendment to the Wildlife Conservation and Management Act, enabling Kenyans living within kilometers of these marine animals to claim compensation if they are injured or die from such attacks. This initiative marks a pivotal move to address rising wildlife-related deaths, injuries, and property damage in Kenya. Before this, only crocodiles and hippos were included in the compensation list. The amendment now covers sharks, stone fish, whales, and sting rays, increasing the scope of assistance. These updates are part of a broader government campaign to tackle animal-wildlife conflicts more effectively.","Kenyan Image Prompt:

Police Officer Dies During Botched Abortion in Nairobi,lose their lives: police officer dies during botched abortion in nairobi,"A policewoman from the elite Rapid Deployment Unit (RDU) has died while allegedly undergoing an abortion in Nairobi.
The officer, a constable, was first taken to a hospital in Kawangware while unconscious after being transferred from another facility. 
However, she did not make it to the wards alive. A doctor at the facility where she was rushed in a private car confirmed that she was already dead and there was no need to admit her.
Police and the doctor indicated that the officer, who was on leave from her station in Embakasi, may have been induced to go into labour, prompting a visit to the initial health facility.

She succumbed to the bleeding, and her body was moved to the mortuary pending an autopsy, according to police.
The incident occurred in Kabiru area, Kawangware.
Following the constable’s death, police arrested a nurse on duty and a driver attached to the facility on Wednesday for questioning.
Married Women Record Highest Number of Abortions
Kenya recorded an estimated 792,694 cases of induced abortion in 2023, according to data from reproductive health stakeholders. This translates to a national rate of 57.3 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age (15–49 years).
The findings further revealed that nearly 80 per cent of those who procured abortions were married women, challenging the common assumption that abortion primarily affects the young or unmarried.
Nairobi and Central Kenya recorded the highest abortion rates, averaging 78.3 per 1,000 women, while the Coast and North Eastern regions posted the lowest at 38.7 per 1,000.
Despite growing awareness and increased access to safe abortion medication, such as misoprostol, used in 89 per cent of reported cases, significant gaps remain in post-abortion care. According to the survey conducted by the African Population and Health Research Centre (APHRC) and the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NADC), only 18 per cent of lower-level health facilities in Kenya meet the minimum standards required to handle post-abortion emergencies, raising concerns about the quality of reproductive health services.
