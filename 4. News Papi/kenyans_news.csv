Ruto Set to Make Changes in Govt,"Kenyans may witness major reshuffles in leadership after President William Ruto signed Executive Order One, the official reference document for the organisation of government.
Ruto's directive, as outlined by the Government Spokesperson Isaac Mwaura, drafts a blueprint for a more transparent, efficient, and citizen-centred administration.
""H.E. President William Ruto has signed Executive Order No. 1 of 2025, outlining the structure of the Government of Kenya. The Executive Order details Ministries, State Departments, and the roles under the Executive Office,"" the statement read in part.
Among the key changes outlined in the order is an updated Cabinet structure, signalling a possible reshuffle in the various ministries. The reorganisation is designed to streamline decision-making processes and create a more agile leadership framework.

The Executive Order also called for the complete overhaul of State Departments, suggesting the removal of redundancies, enhanced coordination, and improved overall efficiency in public service delivery.
One of the most significant aspects of the new directive is the creation of designated coordination roles under the Executive Office of the President. The Office has been expanded to include the Office of the Chief of Staff and Head of Public Service, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, Strategy Delivery Unit, President’s Delivery Unit, and the Presidential Economic Transformation Secretariat.
This move is intended to ensure seamless collaboration between different arms of government, particularly in implementing national policies and development programmes.
The reorganisation has also resulted in the creation of seven new State Departments with distinct mandates. The departments are: National Government Coordination; Science, Research and Innovation; Public Investments and Assets Management; and Special Programmes.
Others are: Aviation and Aerospace Development; Children’s Services; and the Department for Justice, Human Rights and Constitutional Affairs.
The Order has set in motion major changes, including delineating functions and coordinating responsibilities across Ministries and agencies.
With these highlights in place, Kenyans may see some Cabinet Secretaries (CSs) and Principal Secretaries (PSs) reassigned to align with the new directives. The President may also appoint more leaders to fill the newly proposed positions.
President Ruto, who is currently working closely with Raila Odinga through the broad-based government, may include more Raila allies in government as he continues to reward loyalists.
Mwaura has revealed that the Order seeks to realign the administration with the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA).

Details Emerge on Man Accused of Deleting CCTV Footage at Central Police Station,"A CCTV technician believed to be responsible for tampering with crucial footage linked to the death of Albert Ojwang has allegedly been arrested by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI).
The man is said to have been arrested on the morning of Friday, June 13, in a supposed targeted operation at his residence in a populous Nairobi estate.
According to sources privy to the situation, the technician, who had overseen the installation of all 25 cameras at the station in 2024, was called just past 6:00 am on Saturday, June 8, by a police officer at Central Police Station. Aside from the cameras, the man also installed a digital video recorder (DVR) where all captured footage is stored.
The man claims that the officer urged him to report to the station immediately. Upon arrival, he was taken to the office of a senior officer, where the DVR is housed and was allegedly asked to delete footage from Thursday, June 6, and Friday, June 7.

However, it is reported he informed the officers that specific-day deletion was not possible, and the only option was to format the hard drive, which would erase all stored data and restore default settings.
He added that he did not remove anything from the DVR and was given Ksh3,000 by a senior officer after the task.
The latest comes after the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) confirmed that CCTV footage at the station had been tampered with.
IPOA's Deputy Chairperson, Ann Wanjiku, made the revelation on Wednesday, June 11, while appearing before the Senate, where she was grilled on findings from the authority on Ojwang's death.
While confirming that IPOA learnt about Ojwang's death through the media, the deputy chairperson revealed that investigations were immediately launched, which uncovered several inconsistencies in the National Police Service's initial version of events.
""The key findings were that the CCTV systems located at the OCS's office had been interfered with,"" she said.
Ojwang was arrested at his home in Homa Bay County on Friday by DCI officers. The influencer was arrested on allegations of publishing false information, questioned on Saturday, and booked under OB number 136/7/6/2025 at 9:35 pm. 
According to Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja, after investigations, Ojwang, who was a teacher by profession, was later transferred to a holding unit within the station where he was locked up.
However, during routine checks by officers on duty, police later discovered that Ojwang was unconscious in his cell. He was taken to Mbagathi Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival on Sunday, June 8.
A statement by the police claimed that Ojwang's death was by suicide, stating he had hit himself on the wall several times.

However, when the autopsy report by pathologists finally came out, it was confirmed that the late Ojwang died from head injuries, neck compression and multiple soft tissue trauma. This ruled out self-inflicted wounds, as initially suggested by the NPS.

Omtatah Flags Transfer of Ksh 192M Kenya Pipeline Project to Nigerian Firm,"Busia Senator Okiya Omtatah has raised the alarm over the transfer of a Kenya Pipeline project worth Ksh192 million to a private firm, citing three major constitutional violations.
Through a statement released on Friday, June 13, Omtatah referenced a post where he had sought a statement regarding the transfer of the project, expressing his rejection of the response he received from the Energy Ministry on the matter.
“I have rejected the Ministry of Energy’s response regarding the controversial handover of the Kenya Pipeline Company LPG project to a private firm. The reply was shallow and reflected a contemptuous disregard for the Constitution and the laws that protect public assets,” Murkomen stated.
“The Ministry ignored the Public Finance Management Act, the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act, and the Companies Act, under which the Kenya Pipeline Company is registered. These laws are not optional. They are the foundation of accountability in a democracy,” he added.

According to Omtatah, KPC had invested Ksh 192M in preparatory work, including demand surveys, environmental and social impact assessments, engineering designs, but argued the project was undermined when the project was transferred without due process.
As per Omtatah, violation of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), which advocates for prudent management of public funds, occurred after the project was handed over after much significant investment without a clear, legally compliant process. Such could violate Sections 68 and 73 of the PFMA, which require accountability and value for money in public expenditure.
The Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act could have been violated in the selection of the Nigerian firm as the new custodian of the project. Omtatah questioned whether the process of selecting the private firm to develop the gas handling facility followed due process, including competitive bidding and transparency.
The PPADA (Sections 45-50) requires competitive procurement processes, transparency, and fairness in the selection of contractors for public projects. If the firm was selected without adhering to these procedures, it could constitute a breach of the Act.
Omtatah had specifically mentioned the lack of details on received proposals and justifications for contracting the firm, which aligns with the requirements of the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act (PPADA).
In violation of the Companies Act, Omtatah notes that KPC, as a state corporation registered under the Companies Act, should have followed corporate governance principles and legal obligations in its dealings.
The Companies Act (Sections 143–145) requires directors of a company to act in the best interests of the company and its shareholders, the Kenyan public. If the decision to hand over the project was not in the best interests of KPC or was made without proper board approval or shareholder consent, it could amount to a breach of fiduciary duty.
However, the government, in its response, defended the move, noting that a public-private partnership (PPP) was the best way to proceed with the project. They cited budgetary constraints, arguing that due process was followed in the project’s transfer.
As for whether the Ksh192 million would be recouped, the government noted that upcoming meetings with the firm would be key in finding a working formula for both parties.

NPS Cracks Whip After Woman Loses Pregnancy in Police Custody,"The National Police Service has ordered the immediate interdiction of the Rwanyambo Police Post Commander following an unfortunate incident in which a woman miscarried while in custody.
In an official statement, NPS spokesperson Muchiri Nyaga conveyed deep sadness over the incident and assured citizens that urgent measures are underway.
The woman allegedly lost a seven-month-old pregnancy while detained at a local police post in Kinangop, Nyandarua County, an event that has raised painful questions about the conditions of custody.
In response to the incident, an investigation has been launched by the Internal Affairs Unit (IAU), which will be working closely with the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) to determine the precise circumstances surrounding the case.

As part of the immediate action, NPS has interdicted the officer in charge of the police post, effectively removing him from power pending further investigations.
“To ensure a swift, impartial, and transparent investigation, the officer in charge of Rwanyambo Police Post has been interdicted with immediate effect,” the statement read in part.
“The NPS reaffirms its steadfast commitment to serving and protecting the public, while strictly upholding the rule of law, human rights, and fundamental freedoms”, the statement continued.
Nyaga acknowledged the incident as “deeply unfortunate” and affirmed the Service’s commitment to fully cooperate with the ongoing inquiry.
Authorities, however, did not reveal the specific details of the officer interdicted or when the interdiction would take place.
The latest incident continues to raise concerns over how police are handling Kenyans in custody.
According to the victim's sister, she had been arrested after her employer filed a complaint saying Ksh 18,000 from a day's sales was missing.
""I pleaded with the police to release my sister as we tried to raise the money, but they declined. I pleaded with them, informing them that my sister had other children waiting at home and we had a sick mother to take care of, but they refused,"" the victim's sister revealed.
These incidents in police custody continue to ignite concern among Kenyans who have accused the police of heightened brutality at the expense of Kenyan's lives.

Murkomen Reacts to Viral Video of Panga-Wielding Man Confronting Police,"Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen has addressed the recent incident involving a panga-wielding man and police officers in Nakuru.
While speaking on Friday, June 13, the CS criticised Kenyans for supporting the man, noting that the incident could have easily turned chaotic.
""You see police officers trying to restore calm but then you see a man with a panga going after the police officers. Yet you will find some citizens cheering such a person in social media or today,"" Murkomen stated.
He stated that the government would be more stringent on such individuals, adding that the State would “hold civilians accountable.”

He cited the recent case of a police officer’s hand being chopped off during deadly clashes between citizens and police in Narok over a livestock-related issue as an example of what could happen when such incidents turn chaotic.
At the same time, he congratulated the police officers for exercising restraint in the face of the threat posed by the man.
In a viral clip that surfaced online, a man in London Estate, Nakuru, was seen wielding a panga towards police officers during protests.
The man could be seen seemingly threatening to attack the officers with the panga.
In response, an officer was seen lobbing a tear gas canister towards him in an attempt to thwart the man.
However, the man remained unfazed and went ahead to even ‘sharpen’ the panga on the road.
He continued to charge towards them, shouting endeni huko (go away) as the officers retreated.
The youth was among the charged protestors who took to the streets in Nakuru, demonstrating against the fatal shooting of 35-year-old Duncan Nderitu, reportedly by a police officer.
Reports revealed that Nderitu was killed during an altercation when police attempted to arrest a suspected drug peddler in the area. The confrontation reportedly turned chaotic as residents confronted the officers, prompting them to fire in the air to disperse the crowd.

Man Throws 5-Year-Old Baby from Balcony,"Residents of a Nairobi estate are mourning the death of five-year-old Amanda Mutheu, who lost her life at the hands of someone she trusted, her uncle.
In a devastating turn of events, witnesses recounted that the incident unfolded on Thursday night when the man, identified as her uncle by the police, stormed their house and found baby Mutheu in the company of her nanny.
Visibly disturbed and intoxicated, the man created a scene before overpowering the nanny and forcibly taking Mutheu from her arms. Sensing imminent danger, the house girl ran out, screaming for help.
Before anyone could intervene, tragedy struck, and the man threw the child from the balcony.

""The management security patrolling the area, along with neighbours who responded to the screams, rushed to the scene. They were able to subdue the uncle and called the police,"" a statement from the estate read in part.
Visibly angered by his inhumane actions, the residents launched a brutal assault on the man, beating him into a pulp. However, the police intervened swiftly, saving him from a mob intent on taking his life.
While defending himself, the man alleged that he loved the girl so much and could not have thrown her off the balcony; he claimed that what he threw was a doll.
""I did not throw Mutheu, I love her so much, what I threw was a doll, you can check on the CCTV footage, it's a doll that I threw, not a child,"" the man told the residents in a video seen by Kenyans.co.ke.
Police from Kahawa West Police Station booked the suspect at the station before taking him to the Kenyatta University Teaching and Referral Hospital, where he received treatment for the injuries sustained.
Mutheu was also taken to the same hospital and admitted to the emergency unit under the Intensive Care Unit. Unfortunately, minutes later, she was declared dead.
The incident has sent shockwaves among the residents, who are now demanding justice for the young girl who had a promising future. She had begun a career in acting, and from posted videos, Mutheu was talented.
The Sub-County Commander of Kasarani Police Station, Emmanuel Rono, has assured the community and the family that they will ensure justice is served.
""We want to assure the members of the public and the family that justice will be done,"" Rono assured.
Responding to the unfortunate events, the Federation of Women Lawyers in Kenya (FIDA-Kenya) has condemned the act, calling for quick justice for the baby. Consequently, FIDA has deployed an advocate to pursue this matter and follow up with the relevant authorities to ensure that the child and her family receive timely justice.

"CS Mbadi Unveils Ksh 105B Boost for Youth, Hustlers & Small Businesses","The government has set aside Ksh105 billion to support young people and small businesses in the 2025/2026 budget.
National Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi, while presenting the budget in the National Assembly on Thursday, June 12, said that in the Ksh105 billion budget, the National Youth Service will receive Ksh10 billion for training and recruitment.
He further announced an increase of Ksh318 million to the Youth Enterprise Development Fund, which provides loans to young entrepreneurs.
For the creative sector, under the Film Department Service, the government allocated Ksh990 million to be used for entertainment.

Additionally, the government proposed Ksh3.6 billion for the National Youth Opportunity Towards Advancement (NYOTA) program.
“I have proposed Ksh105.6 billion for these initiatives. This allocation includes: Ksh10.0 billion for the National Youth Service; Ksh3.6 billion to National Youth Opportunity Towards Advancement (NYOTA), and Ksh318 million for the Youth Enterprise Development Fund.""
""In addition, I have proposed Ksh990 million for Film Development Services,” CS Mbadi said.
Mbadi said that the Ksh300 million top-up would be allocated to the Hustler Fund to help with the loans.
This will provide low-interest loans to households and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to ease their financing difficulties.
Mbadi revealed that the Youth Enterprise Development Fund will receive an additional Ksh308 million to support young entrepreneurs through loans and business support.
“I have proposed an additional allocation of Ksh300 million to the Hustler Fund to scale up access to credit for households and MSMEs. I have also proposed an additional Ksh308 million for the youth enterprise development fund,” Mbadi said.
He noted that the proposed allocation is to expand financial and developmental job opportunities in the country.
To create more job opportunities for young people, CS Mbadi said the government has begun rolling out Climate WorX, a nationwide initiative aimed at employing over 110,000 youth across all 47 counties.
The programme, which was first launched last year in Nairobi’s informal settlements, is now being expanded countrywide following its initial success.
The CS described the initiative as a social support programme that empowers young people to improve their communities. 
“The youth will help build roads, plant trees, and clean up the environment in their neighbourhoods,” he said.

Mbagathi Hospital Medics Introduce Fresh Twist in Albert Ojwang Murder,"A new twist has emerged in the unfortunate death of a teacher and social media influencer, Albert Ojwang, after a report by Mbagathi Hospital revealed that he was brought in already dead.
According to the report, Ojwang's body was brought in at 2:00am on Sunday, long after he had ceased to live.
This information is in sharp contrast to earlier claims by police officers that he was rushed to the hospital for immediate medical attention.
The report by the hospital detailed that Ojwang was discovered bearing extensive and gruesome injuries. His face was notably swollen, and his limbs were marred with a series of severe bruises, showing the violent nature of the attack.
A photo of Albert Ojwang, who passed away under unclear circumstances on Sunday, June 8 2025. PHOTO ALBERT OJWANG.
In a vivid description of the injuries, the nurses on duty revealed that Ojwang was oozing blood relentlessly from the back of his head, his mouth, and his eyes. 
Additionally, a distinct cut was noted in the parieto-occipital region, reinforcing the theory of a brutal assault rather than self-inflicted harm.
""His face was swollen. His body and limbs were marred by multiple bruises,"" the report details.
Through a careful medical examination, the nurses also observed that there was no chance for medical intervention; the teacher's condition was beyond help when he arrived.
Their accounts indicate that the body had been in a state of decay that is inconsistent with someone who had been alive minutes before.
Adding to the mystery, the hospital's documents disclosed that Ojwang's body was transported from the Central Police Station.
This detail directly contradicts the earlier narrative provided by police officials regarding his transport for emergency care. While police IG Douglas Kanja revealed that Ojwang was taken to the hospital at 1:39 am, the official hospital record marks his arrival at 2:00 am.
The inconsistency in timings, events, and his condition between the police and the hospital's reports raises serious questions about the chain of custody and the actual events at the police station.
This revelation by the hospital continues to raise more questions about the death that has sparked tension in the country. Already, businesses were brought to a standstill in Nairobi on Thursday as youths took to the streets demanding justice over the unfortunate incident.

Senator Flags ‘Secret Move’ Impacting Kiambu Locals,"Kiambu County, led by Governor Kimani wa Matangi, has been put on the spot after the county senator, Karungo wa Thang'wa, raised an alarm over unexplained land rates in the county.
Appearing before the Senate's Standing Committee on Lands, the senator alleged that residents had been subjected to hiked land rates without prior notice or public participation.
According to the senator, the county is facing an arbitrary increase in land rates without proper legal process, transparency, or public participation, as mandated by the Constitution and the National Rating Act of 2025.
“Residents of Kiambu have reported a surge in land rates with no explanation, no notice, and no access to the valuation roll used to determine the charges,” the senator said.

The senator, who is now seeking a statement from the committee, is accusing the county leadership, led by the governor, of violating the principles of fairness, equity, and accountability in public governance.
While demanding accountability and a proper explanation, the senator now wants the county government to disclose whether a valuation roll exists, who prepared it, and when it was prepared.
The senator also wants evidence of public participation that led to the increased land rates and the legal basis used to calculate the current rates. The issue has sparked outrage among Kiambu property owners, many of whom claim they have been blindsided by the increase.
The senator questioned why residents are being forced to pay significantly higher land rates despite poor or non-existent service delivery, including road maintenance and waste management.
“It is unacceptable that citizens are being billed for services they do not receive. We will not allow the people of Kiambu to be overburdened by opaque taxation,” he emphasised.
The statement now awaits a formal response from the Chairperson of the Committee on Lands, who will be expected to investigate and provide clarity on the county government’s compliance with the law.
As tension mounts within the county over the land rates, all eyes are now on the governor and the entire leadership to address the concerns swiftly and uphold transparency in governance.
The issue of land rates in counties always proves to be a major issue, with business owners and counties brushing over the balance to raise county revenue and sustain businesses in the counties.

Billions NIS & Police Have Been Allocated in 2025/26 Budget,"In a bid to improve national security, the government has allocated over Ksh464.8 billion of the Ksh4.29 trillion 2025/26 budget to the sector.
While reading the budget on Thursday, June 12, the National Treasury Cabinet Secretary, John Mbadi, highlighted the crucial role of a safe nation in building the economy.
""A stable and secure environment fosters investment, trade, and overall economic growth,"" he stated.
The defence sector has been allocated the biggest chunk of the total, with a proposal of Ksh202.3 billion to run its affairs.

The National Police Service (NPS) follows shortly behind, having been allocated Ksh125.7 billion to enforce law and order across the country.
The intelligence and counter-intelligence agency, the National Intelligence Service (NIS), on the other hand, has been allocated Ksh51.4 billion to run its affairs.
Correctional services, through the Kenya Prisons Service, have been allocated Ksh38.1 billion, and lastly, the Internal Security National Administration has been allocated Ksh32.5 billion.
Besides these crucial sectors, Mbadi has also proposed several other millions that will be used to facilitate the security sector.
These include an additional allocation of Ksh10 billion for the leasing of police motor vehicles and Ksh3.6 billion for the Police Modernisation Programme.
To combat crime and enhance the administration of justice, Mbadi has also proposed Ksh1.2 billion to construct and modernise National Forensic Facilities.
The security sector is thus arguably one of the winners in the year's budget of Ksh4.29 trillion.
Elsewhere, to empower youth and women, Mbadi proposed Ksh10.0 billion for the National Youth Service; Ksh3.6 billion for the National Youth Opportunity Towards Advancement (NYOTA), and Ksh318 million for the Youth Enterprise Development Fund.

How the 2025/2026 Budget Will Affect Income Tax,"Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi has outlined a raft of income tax changes in the 2025/2026 Budget, aimed at boosting revenue collection while easing the burden on Kenyan workers and businesses.
While presenting the budget estimates before the National Assembly, Mbadi announced that the Finance Bill 2025 would introduce reforms to eliminate ambiguities in tax laws and promote equity within the tax system.
Among the notable changes is the full exemption of all gratuity payments, whether from the public or private sector, from taxation.
This move follows the enactment of the Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 2024, which had exempted pensions and gratuity payments but left uncertainty around gratuities from private pension schemes.

This means retirees across both public and private sectors will take home their full terminal benefits without any deductions, offering financial relief to thousands of Kenyans exiting the workforce.
“To eliminate any confusion, we are now proposing an amendment to clarify that all gratuity payments are exempt from tax,” Mbadi stated.
In a move targeting cross-border tax disputes involving multinationals, the Bill will also empower the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) Commissioner to enter into Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) with multinational companies. This is expected to reduce litigation and ensure predictable tax treatment for global firms operating in Kenya.
For local businesses, the Treasury has proposed accelerated tax relief on industrial and operational items, such as linen and tools. 
Under the new plan, businesses will be allowed to deduct the full cost of qualifying items in the year of purchase, a departure from the current practice of spreading deductions over three years.
To promote home ownership, the Finance Bill proposes expanding mortgage interest relief to include individuals who take loans to construct their own residential homes. Currently, this relief is only available for mortgages used to purchase or improve existing homes.
If passed, the change will allow Kenyans building their own homes to benefit from tax relief on interest paid on construction loans, just like those buying or renovating houses. The move aims to make home ownership more affordable and inclusive.
“These measures are designed to stimulate economic activity, promote fairness in tax treatment, and provide clarity in implementation,” the CS added.
The proposed changes are expected to take effect in the new fiscal year, subject to parliamentary approval of the Finance Bill.

Police Make First Arrest in Albert Ojwang Murder,"Authorities have made their first arrest in the case involving the murder of blogger Albert Ojwang.
A police officer attached to the Central Police Station was apprehended on Thursday, June 12, with reports reaching Kenyans.co.ke indicating he is being held at the Capitol Hill Police Station. 
“Please be informed that an officer of Central Police Station Nairobi, was arrested today, 12/06/2025 and placed in custody at Capitol Hill Police Station by officers from the Internal Affairs Unit (IAU) and the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA),” a memo released on the evening of Thursday, June 12 read. 
The arrest followed an extensive investigation by the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA), which revealed to the Administration and Internal Security Committee that an arrest announcement would be confirmed on Thursday.

On Wednesday, IPOA released the names of six officers involved in the arrest of Ojwang’ from the Leaders Centre in Homa Bay County on Friday, June 7.
Notably, the arrested officer was not among the names released by Vice Chairperson Ann Mwangi before the Senate.
While it remains unclear whether the arrested officer was directly involved in Ojwang's killing, his apprehension is believed to be linked to glaring inconsistencies in how officers handled the situation when the late influencer was first brought to the station.
In addition to allegedly failing to book Ojwang, officers on duty on June 7 have come under scrutiny after it emerged that CCTV cameras had been tampered with.
IPOA Chairperson Issack Hassan revealed on Thursday that digital video recorder (DVR) logs showed the discs were replaced on June 8, 2025, at exactly 07:23:29 and 07:23:48 hours after Ojwang was brought in.
According to IPOA’s account, Ojwang was booked at 9:35 p.m. on June 7.
Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja also revealed on Thursday that experts were looking at the CCTV hard drive to reconstruct footage.
Investigations are also closing in on the individual responsible for unplugging the CCTV power source, after it emerged that the cameras were conveniently offline around the time Ojwang was brought into the station.

Senator Onyonka Makes Bold Demand Ahead of 2027 Elections,"Kisii Senator Richard Onyonka has called for a review of constituency boundaries ahead of the 2027 General Election.
On Thursday, June 12, Onyonka urged the Senate Standing Committee on Justice, Legal Affairs, and Human Rights to fast-track the process, noting that it is long overdue.
According to Onyonka, the accelerating population growth in some counties, such as Kisii, Nyamira, and Migori Counties, will undermine equitable representation in the upcoming general polls if constituency boundaries are not reviewed on time.
Onyonka further emphasised the need for clear policies to prevent future delays in boundary reviews and to uphold the constitutional rights of Kenyan citizens to fair representation in Parliament.

""The Senator expressed concern that population growth in counties such as Kisii, Nyamira, and Migori has resulted in constituencies that are disproportionately large, undermining the principle of equitable representation,"" a statement from Parliament read.
""The review of constituency and ward boundaries, as required by Article 89 of the Constitution, is overdue and must be conducted to ensure fairness in representation and effective service delivery,"" it added.
The Constitution mandates the IEBC to review constituency boundaries and names at intervals of not less than eight years and not more than twelve years.
The IEBC last reviewed constituency boundaries on March 7, 2012. The next review, which was initially scheduled for 2020, has been delayed by four years.
The issue of constituency boundaries has long stirred debate in Kenya’s political space. A month ago, former Farmers Party Leader Irungu Nyakera warned that 27 constituencies risk being scrapped if the boundary review process is not initiated soon.
Nyakera, in a statement on Tuesday, April 22, said that the scrapping of these constituencies, which he claims their existence is temporary, would affect the upcoming general elections because it would mean that no member of parliament could be elected from them in the 2027 general elections.
According to Nyakera, these constituencies were created in 2010 under an exception, as they did not meet the population threshold required by the Constitution.
“To avert an impending crisis, the IEBC should be immediately reconstituted, and the NADCO legislative proposals enacted to either extend the timeline for the boundary review or provide permanent protection for these constituencies,” Nyakera said. “The Supreme Court should also give its advisory opinion and provide legal clarity.”
He added that the Constitution allowed the constituencies to exist temporarily on the condition that the IEBC would conduct a boundary review by March 2024 at the latest.

Water Plant Shut Down After University Student Jumps In,"A college in Kabarnet, Eldoret, is mourning the death of one of its students who died by suicide.
In an official statement, the Eldoret Water and Sanitation Company (ELDOWAS) confirmed that the student jumped into one of its treatment tanks on Wednesday, June 11. Unfortunately, efforts by staff to save him were unsuccessful.
""The Eldoret Water and Sanitation Company (ELDOWAS) confirms a tragic incident that occurred on the afternoon of June 11, 2025, at the Kesses Water Treatment Plant, where a young man gained unauthorized access and jumped into one of the water treatment tanks,"" the statement read in part.
""Despite swift efforts by our staff to intervene, the individual could not be saved,"" the statement continued.

Details of the reason why the student took his own life remain scanty, but Kenyans took the opportunity to challenge parents and families to be actively involved in their children's lives.
In response to the unfortunate incident, ELDOWAS has temporarily shut down the Kesses Water Treatment Plant as a precautionary measure.
Comprehensive cleaning, flushing, and disinfection of the treatment tanks and pipelines are currently underway, with public health authorities supervising the process.
Additionally, independent laboratory testing has been commissioned to ensure that the water meets all regulatory safety standards before supply is fully restored. ELDOWAS has assured customers that no contaminated water has been distributed.
""Independent laboratory testing is being conducted to ensure that all water meets regulatory safety standards before supply is restored. To minimize service disruption, alternative water supply arrangements have been activated for the affected areas,"" the facility added.
This incident comes barely a month after yet another youth had thrown himself from a building in Thika.
Cases of suicide among the youth remain alarmingly high. While Kenya continues to advocate for mental health, many young people are silently battling challenges that may be contributing to the rising cases.
General mental health struggles, alongside financial, academic, and social pressures, have been identified as key factors driving the unfortunate trend.
Counsellors, medics, and psychologists continue to urge anyone experiencing mental health issues to seek help. You can call the Kenya Red Cross toll-free hotline, 1199, for support.

This accounts for about 28 per cent of the total budget, underscoring the sector's crucial role in driving economic growth.
""The education sector plays a vital role in economic development by enhancing human capital, driving innovation, and improving productivity,"" he stated.

State Gives Way Forward on Ngong Forest Evictions,"The government has clarified its stance on potential evictions from the disputed 34-acre section of Ngong Forest.
Environment, Climate Change and Forestry Cabinet Secretary Deborah Barasa appeared before the National Assembly’s Committee on Implementation on Thursday, June 12, where she assured residents occupying the contested land that no evictions would take place until a Cabinet decision is reached.
According to the CS, the Ministry had complied with previous House resolutions that directed a halt to threats or attempts to repossess the land from residents in Lang’ata Constituency.
“After the advice from Parliament, no threats from government or the Kenya Forest Service have been issued to the residents, and normalcy has been achieved,” she said.
Health CS Deborah Barasa during a press briefing at Afya House, March 5, 2025 PHOTO HEALTH CS DEBORAH BARASA
The land in question, which hosts more than 20,000 families, has long been the subject of dispute from as far back as 2020.
Initially, the residents claimed they acquired the property legally. However, this claim was disputed after the arrival of Kenya Forest Service (KFS) rangers, who said the land belongs to the agency.
Earlier, the house adopted a report by the Departmental Committee on Environment and Natural Resources recommending amicable dialogue between the Ministry and its residents.
After the adoption of the report, CS Barasa revealed that KFS officers toned down with the series of threats, which was previously the norm.
Further, the CS noted that constructive engagements had already taken place between forest management authorities and communities in the area, and there was peaceful coexistence between government agencies and the residents.
“All public forests are managed by the government for the public good, for present and future generations. It is the responsibility of the government to maintain and protect the integrity of public forests, including the creation of institutions,"" CS Barasa added.
""Furthermore, the Forest Conservation and Management Act (FCMA), Cap 385, provides for Community Forest Associations for members of the public living around all public forests.""
Several establishments sit within the 34-acre area, including Lang’ata View Estate, Shalom Estate, Forest Edge View Estate, St. Mary’s Hospital, Lang’ata Women Prison, the Police Dog Unit, and Bomas of Kenya, among others.
As per the House resolution on Thursday, any legal process involving the land must comply with Section 34 of the FCMA, 2016, which deals with the variation of boundaries or revocation of public forests.
Specifically, the Act outlines the step-by-step process through which the boundaries of public forests can be altered or the registration of a public forest, or part of it, revoked.

Govt Announces SIM Card Changes for Refugees in Kenya,"The government has urged all refugees in the country to refrain from registering their SIM cards using borrowed Kenyan IDs and instead use their own Refugee IDs.
In a notice on Thursday, June 12, the Department of Refugee Services announced that all refugees in the country can legally register their SIM cards using their Refugee ID, enabling access to essential services such as mobile money.
The department directed all refugees who had used someone else’s ID card to register their SIM cards to immediately regularise their registration.
According to the department, registering a SIM card with another person’s ID violates Regulation 9 of the new Kenya Information and Communications Regulations, 2025.

“Pursuant to the gazettement of The Kenya Information and Communications (Registration of Telecommunications Service Subscribers) Regulations 2025, DRS is hereby urging all refugees who have registered mobile phone SIM cards using borrowed Kenyan IDs to cease the practice immediately and regularise their SIM card registration,” it stated.
“Proxy registration of SIM cards is therefore in violation of Regulation 9 of the new Kenya Information and Communications Regulations, 2025. All concerned individuals are urged to take immediate action to comply,” it added.
The announcement comes two months after the Cabinet, through a statement on Tuesday, March 11, endorsed the Shirika Plan, a strategy aimed at supporting refugees with a focus on long-term development rather than short-term aid.
Through the plan, the government aims to integrate refugees into host communities, addressing issues that have led to unrest and protests among refugee populations.
Under the Shirika plan, refugees in the country will also be given opportunities to work and contribute to the country's economy.
Furthermore, according to the Cabinet, refugee camps will be transformed into areas with essential infrastructure like schools, hospitals, and housing through the plan.
""In addressing refugee management, the Cabinet endorsed the Shirika Plan, a transformative framework shifting Kenya’s approach from humanitarian aid to a development-focused model,"" the statement read.
""The plan seeks to integrate refugees into host communities by transforming camps into sustainable settlements equipped with essential infrastructure, resources, and economic opportunities,""  it added.

US Issues Warning After Protests in Nairobi CBD,"U.S. citizens have been warned against going to the Nairobi Central Business District (CBD) after protests took a chaotic turn on Thursday, June 12.
In a travel advisory, the United States Department of State cited the use of tear gas and live ammunition as an indication that the demonstrations pose a risk, particularly to American citizens.
""Violent protests are currently underway in the Central Business District (CBD) of Nairobi,"" the alert stated. ""Unverified reports have indicated the use of tear gas and live ammunition.""
As a result, the Bureau of Consular Affairs urged U.S. citizens currently in Kenya to exercise extreme caution and avoid the CBD until the situation stabilises.

Part of the cautionary measures U.S. citizens were urged to observe included avoiding crowds and notifying friends and family of their whereabouts at all times.
The bureau also advised its citizens to always carry their U.S. passport with a valid Kenyan visa in case they are required to present it to authorities.
Additionally, U.S. citizens were encouraged to follow local media for fresh developments and updates on the ongoing protests.
By Thursday afternoon, protests in the Nairobi CBD had escalated, forcing police to disperse an irate crowd using teargas canisters.
The demonstrations disrupted activities for most of the afternoon, with protestors turning up in their hundreds to rally around two main issues, the murder of blogger Albert Ojwang' and the 2025/2026 Budget, which was presented before Parliament by Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi.
Vandalism was also reported, with several newly installed bins removed from their original stations and carried along the roads by protestors, despite earlier warnings from the county government issued less than a month ago.
An unfortunate scene unfolded near Kenya Cinema, where two vehicles were set ablaze amid clashes between civilians and anti-riot police.
In its advisory, the U.S. also urged its citizens to keep their doors locked and windows rolled up while travelling in private vehicles.

Govt to Spend Ksh700M on New System to End Corruption,"The government has proposed an allocation of Ksh700 million towards the implementation of the Electronic Government Procurement (eGP) system.
Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi, while presenting the 2025/2026 budget estimates before the National Assembly, confirmed that the significant sum would go towards rolling out the programme, which is aimed at addressing and sealing corruption loopholes in procurement within government agencies.
''The government is committed to transparency and accountability in procurement. In this regard, I have proposed an allocation of Ksh700 million for rolling out the implementation of the Electronic Government Procurement (eGP),'' Mbadi announced.
The government has set the 2025/2026 budget at Ksh4.29 trillion, which it aims to finance through revenues, loans, and grants from financial partners.

The World Bank confirmed the government's new procurement system, eGP, was among the strict conditions it has placed for further loans to Kenya.  
The international lender told Bloomberg that it will unlock further financing for Kenya on the condition that President William Ruto's government implements wide-ranging economic reforms agreed on last year.
Meanwhile, the government is set to roll out the electronic procurement system in July, with 400 suppliers and national and county staff already trained.
With the rollout scheduled for July, all Kenyans seeking government tenders, bid bonds, procurement plans, tender evaluations, and budgetary allocations must use the eGP system.
The eGP platform was formally launched on April 7, 2025, at the Kenya School of Government. The system is aligned with the Digital Superhighway Agenda, which aims to deliver 80 per cent of public services online.
The system supports open contracting in compliance with international standards and enables full bid submission, evaluation, and contract award online.
Meanwhile, total revenue collections, including appropriation-in-aid for the 2025/2026 financial year, are projected at Ksh3.321 trillion.
Total expenditure is estimated at Ksh4.291 trillion, with Ksh3.134 trillion allocated to recurrent spending and Ksh693.2 billion set aside for development.
County governments are projected to receive a total allocation of Ksh474.9 billion.

KRA Introduces New Way of Filing Taxes as Deadline Nears,"Kenyans can now file their 'Nil returns' through eCitizen, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has revealed.
This marks a major shift by the authority as it seeks to simplify tax compliance among Kenyans, with the June 30 deadline fast approaching. The taxman is exploring more ways to offer taxpayers a simpler and more accessible way to meet their tax obligations.
“You can now file NIL returns on eCitizen; filing taxes has never been this easy. Use this and escape the commotion,” the statement read in part.
KRA has, however, clarified that as of now, only the Nil returns can be filed through the eCitizen. 
KRA offices in Nairobi. PHOTO KENYA INSIGHTS
Previously, all taxes, including the Nil returns, were exclusively filed through iTax; however, KRA has now integrated tax services into eCitizen, a platform widely used for government services.
KRA seeks to reduce system downtimes, which Kenyans usually experience, especially in the rush hours during the last days of tax filing. It is also aimed at making filing more user-friendly.
How to file Nil returns on eCitizen; 
Kenyans have been encouraged to visit the eCitizen portal, log in with their normal eCitizen credentials, and then go to eCitizen KRA.
After logging in, select KRA services and navigate to the tax filing section. In the section, choose Nil returns if you had no taxable income. Confirm details, including KRA pin and personal details, are correct.
After confirmation, click submit, and you will receive a confirmation message.
The taxman has assured Kenyans that the system is secure and that all tax records will be automatically updated upon submission.
The shift to eCitizen is part of KRA's broader strategy to modernise tax collection and increase compliance.
The authority noted that many Kenyans fail to file returns due to the complex processes on iTax, and eCitizen aims to simplify this.
This is also a move to centralise digital services in government, as it seeks to make eCitizen the go-to platform for accessing various, if not all, government functions under one umbrella.
Kenyans have until June 30 to file their taxes; failure to which could result in penalties. KRA has encouraged Kenyans to take advantage of the simplified process and ensure compliance before the deadline.

High Court Blocks Ruto’s Order on Public Seal Transfer,"The High Court has issued conservatory orders halting the implementation of the controversial transfer of the Public Seal from the Attorney General to the Head of Public Service.
Justice Chacha Mwita delivered the ruling on Thursday, June 12, stating that the transfer raised fundamental constitutional and legal issues of public importance that must be fully heard before any action is taken.
“A conservatory order is hereby issued restraining or stopping implementation of Executive Order No. 2 of 2023 to the extent that it purports to reorganise government and transfer the Public Seal from the custody of the Office of the Attorney General to the Head of Public Service in the Executive Office of the President, until further orders of the Court,” the judge ruled.
The court decision came barely 24 hours after lobby group Katiba Institute filed a petition on Wednesday. In the petition, they argued that Executive Order No. 2 of 2023 remained operational despite clearly violating the Constitution and the doctrine of separation of powers.
The Public Seal, December 8, 2023. PHOTO OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
Executive Order No. 2 of 2023 outlines the organisational structure of the Kenyan government, specifying the roles and responsibilities of various Ministries, State Departments, and Agencies.
In their petition, Katiba Institute argued that President William Ruto bypassed Parliament through the Executive Order, in what they termed a blatant power grab.
The transition of the Public Seal from the traditional custody of the Attorney General to the office of the Head of Public Service (HOPS) was facilitated by the National Assembly Administration Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2023. The bill proposed to amend the Office of the Attorney-General Act, 2012, effectively stripping the Attorney General of the authority to host the Seal.
Following a review of the petition, the High Court concluded that there were sufficient grounds to issue conservatory orders.
“This matter coming up for directions on the Notice of Motion and Petition… I am satisfied that the petition raises fundamental constitutional and legal matters of great public importance,” Justice Mwita stated in his written directive.
By issuing the conservatory orders, the High Court effectively blocked any implementation of the executive directive, specifically the transfer of the Public Seal, pending further court directions.
The Court also gave the petitioner seven days to file supplementary affidavits and written submissions not exceeding ten pages. The respondents will then have seven days to submit their responses.
The Public Seal plays a crucial role as a national symbol and a tool for authenticating official government documents. The Seal consists of the coat of arms of Kenya set on a grayscale background featuring two lions, a symbol of protection, holding spears and a traditional East African shield.
It serves as a mark of authenticity for key government documents, ensuring their legitimacy and official status. It is affixed to documents to confirm that they have been issued or approved by the state.
As a national symbol, it represents the authority of the Kenyan state and is a formal marker of sovereignty.

KHRC Shares Emergency Phone Numbers For Protestors,"Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC) has released special emergency phone numbers for people taking part in the ongoing protests.
The demonstrations began on Thursday, June 12, with a section of youths taking to the streets.
In response to the growing tension and demonstrations, KHRC urged protestors to keep emergency numbers close in case they are arrested or find themselves in danger.
“During today's protest and many more to come, please call these numbers if security officers arrest you or in case of an emergency,” KHRC said in a public statement.

Protestors are demanding justice following the death of blogger Albert Ojwang and are calling for the resignation of Deputy Inspector General Eliud Lagat.
Police were forced to lob tear gas canisters at youths protesting in Nairobi’s Central Business District to disperse the crowds.
The protestors marched through key locations, including City Hall, Moi Avenue, Harambee Avenue, Jeevanjee Gardens, and the Parliament buildings.
Many carried placards and waved flags while singing the national anthem and calling for Lagat to step down.
Despite tear gas being fired at them, protestors continued chanting. One placard read, “You cannot kill us and lead us.”
Videos and images obtained by Kenyans.co.ke showed some cars set on fire, although the fires were later extinguished.
Burning tyres were also seen on the roads. Business owners in the area were forced to close their shops for safety.
The phone numbers provided are from several organisations, including the Law Society of Kenya, Amnesty International, Defenders Coalition, KHRC, Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR), Civics Freedom Forum, and the Independent Medico-Legal Unit (IMLU).
These organisations are offering legal support, medical help, and rapid response services during the demonstrations.

Boniface Mwangi Faces Arrest,"Activist and photojournalist Boniface Mwangi risks arrest after failing to appear in court to answer charges of assaulting police officers.
According to the charge sheet, Mwangi is accused of assaulting two officers on separate occasions while they were discharging their official duties.
In the first count, he allegedly assaulted Sergeant Osman Omar on April 20 at the Metropolitan Court in the Kilimani area, Dagoretti Sub-County, Nairobi, causing actual bodily harm while the officer was on duty.
In a second count, Mwangi is accused of wilfully assaulting Police Constable Robert Oyola at the same location on April 2, also causing actual bodily harm.

Further, the activist faces an additional charge of using abusive language against Sergeant Omar on April 2 at the Metropolitan Court along Airwing Kodhek Road, Kilimani, with the intent to provoke a breach of peace.
Initially, in his official X account on Monday, April 21, Boni, as he is popularly known, claimed that the incident, which involved three officers from the Kilimani Police Station, happened on the night of Wednesday, April 2, where he claimed to have been assaulted.
According to Mwangi, the three officers approached him in his office, saying they were responding to an alleged noise complaint. One of the officers, who Mwangi claims was drunk and was chewing miraa, started roughing him up and, at some point, even attempted to shoot him with his firearm.
""I tried to ask the senior officer at the scene why the officer was working and carrying a firearm while intoxicated and chewing miraa. That’s when all hell broke loose, and a scuffle ensued,"" he narrated.
The court has directed that the matter be mentioned on July 14, adding to the latest challenges facing the activist. 
On May 22, Mwangi had to be airlifted to Nairobi for treatment after he could not walk properly after being tortured by Tanzanian Intelligence officers, following his trip to the East African nation. 
This was after he was found abandoned in Ukunda, Kwale County, which is approximately 92 kilometres north of the Tanzanian border at Lunga Lunga. The activist was deported by road from Dar es Salaam.
Speaking during a press briefing on Monday, June 2, Mwangi recalled being stripped naked, flogged, and even sodomised using objects during his time in captivity in Tanzania.
""They tied me upside down, and then they started beating my feet. I was screaming so hard, but no tears were coming out because of how painful it was. One of them suggested that they put underwear in my mouth, so they did. To drown my screams, they were playing gospel music,"" he narrated following the ordeal.
He was among the activists who travelled to Tanzania on May 19 to show solidarity with Tanzania's opposition leader Tundu Lissu, who is facing treason charges for calling for electoral reform.

Somali Parliament Staff to Get Attachments in Kenya's National Assembly,"National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang'ula has revealed that the government is set to offer attachment opportunities to Somali parliamentary personnel in the Kenyan Parliament.
In a statement on his official X account on Thursday, June 12, Wetang'ula claimed that the staff will soon be incorporated into various committees within the Kenyan National Assembly for practical, on-the-job learning experiences.
Additionally, the Speaker claimed that the Centre for Parliamentary Studies (CPST) will also facilitate more capacity-building programmes for the staff.
Wetang'ula has further proposed the formation of a Kenya-Somalia Parliamentary ""friendship"" group that will enable lawmakers from the two countries to have sustainable diplomatic engagements.

""In response to Speaker Madobe’s request, I affirmed Kenya’s readiness to support the capacity building of Somali parliamentary staff through training facilitated by Kenyan institutions such as the CPST and benchmarking programmes,"" Wetang'ula said.
""To further enhance this initiative, I assured the Ambassador that Somali parliamentary personnel would be attached to various committees within the Kenyan National Assembly for practical, on-the-job learning experiences,"" he added.
According to Wetang'ula, who revealed this after a meeting with the Somali Ambassador to Kenya, Jabril Ibrahim Abdulle, on Thursday, June 12, these efforts are aimed at strengthening diplomatic ties and cooperation between the two countries.
During the meeting, Wetang'ula stressed the need for integrating Somalia into the East African regional bloc, a move he asserted will be critical in catalysing the economic metamorphosis of the region.
""Reiterating my longstanding support for Somalia’s full membership in the East African Community (EAC), I emphasised the importance of Somalia’s integration into the regional bloc to promote collective development and stability across East Africa,"" he stated.
The announcement comes days after Kenya emphasised its commitment to Somalia’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence, in line with international law and regional agreements.
Acknowledging Kenya and Somalia's strong historical and cultural ties, the government assured that these foundations will continue to guide the two nations’ shared aspirations for peace, security, and sustainable development in the region.
""Kenya unequivocally recognises the authority of the Federal Government in Mogadishu as the sole and legitimate body responsible for administering the affairs of Somalia, including those of its regions,"" read a statement by the State Department of Foreign Affairs on Monday, May 26.

Standard Group CEO to Step Down After Brief Tenure,"The Standard Group CEO, Marion Gathoga-Mwangi, has announced that she will be stepping down from her role, barely a year after she took over the group's leadership on July 15, 2024.
Announcing her planned exit in the latest newsletter to the media house employees, she cited personal circumstances as the motivation for her exit and revealed that the transition process had already begun.
""To everything, however, there is a season, and a time for every purpose under the heavens. In this respect, therefore, personal circumstances that I cannot overlook have informed my decision on my future with the company,"" she wrote.
""Although I have not yet left, the transition has begun, and this may be the last newsletter I write to you. As I take this step, I ask for your prayers and well wishes.""

In the newsletter, Gathoga-Mwangi expressed immense gratitude to both the leadership and other employees at Standard Group for granting her support during her tenure, especially over the last couple of months.
“As we continue our journey of transformation, I want to take a moment to express my deep gratitude for the encouragement and support you have extended to me during this pivotal time,” the newsletter read.
“Over the past two months, I have found myself at a significant crossroads, one that has reminded me of the power of community, the importance of staying anchored in our values, and the role each of us plays in shaping the future of Standard Group PLC.”
She further highlighted several achievements made during her tenure, including completing the company's strategic plan to move to a 'business unusual' mode for long-term sustainability and shepherding the rights issue, a defining step towards stabilising our business in these turbulent times.
Other highlights she outlined were reducing operational costs, introducing the Continuous Improvement (CI) matrix, and, most importantly, solidifying a leadership team, led by Chaacha Mwita, that will safeguard the group's mission with clarity and purpose.
Gathoga-Mwangi took over the CEO position in July, replacing Joe Munene, who had held the position in an interim capacity since July 6, 2023.
Before joining Standard Group, she had served in various executive roles at The Linde Group PLC companies, such as African Oxygen Pty (AFROX) and BOC Kenya PLC, with her most notable contributions including enhancing access to medical gases across Africa and managing bulk and onsite manufacturing operations in South Africa.
She has yet to announce her next career move after her brief tenure at the media house, which has been grappling with financial instability for years now.

"Mosiria Goes After Mutura, Fish Vendors in Nairobi","Nairobi County has taken swift action against unsanitary food handling practices in Gikomba Market, shutting down some kiosks and issuing notices to seven other vendors over poor hygiene conditions.
The crackdown follows shocking revelations of fish vendors preparing and selling fish next to open urinals, raising serious public health concerns.
Nairobi County Chief Officer for Environment Geoffrey Mosiria led the crackdown along the Kombo Munyiri Road, where county officials uncovered filthy and unsafe food preparation areas.
In addition to the kiosk shutdowns, traders were warned that failure to improve hygiene standards would result in further closures.

""We found traders selling fish in extremely unhygienic environments, some even preparing food near areas used as open urinals. This is completely unacceptable, and we will take firm action against those endangering public health,"" Mosiria stated.
Further, the inspection also revealed poor handling of mutura, a city delicacy, which was being sold in conditions deemed unfit for consumption.
The county official warned the traders that reckless disregard for hygiene could lead to severe penalties, including business licence revocations.
""To make matters worse, the mutura being sold in the same vicinity was in a similarly filthy condition, posing a serious risk to public health. In response, we closed down two kiosks that were preparing and selling fish to innocent city residents under unsanitary conditions,"" Mosiria revealed.
Beyond food safety, traders were also warned against dumping waste into stormwater drainage systems, a habit they have adopted that is costing city dwellers by blocking waterways, causing flooding, and contributing to environmental pollution.
The city officials emphasised that hygiene practices in market areas directly affect both public health and environmental sustainability.
Mosiria further condemned the move by vendors who are paying street families Ksh50 to dispose of waste in illegal places, terming it as irresponsible and unlawful.
While encouraging the traders to use proper disposal channels, Mosiria revealed that this practice worsens garbage mismanagement in the city.
The county, which is hell-bent on ensuring hygiene practices are followed, has warned that it will be conducting regular inspections across major food markets to ensure compliance with hygiene regulations.
Businesses found violating standards will face closure or fines, as the county government works to protect consumers from contaminated food.

Newly Installed CBD Waste Bins Destroyed,"Nairobi County is counting losses after the newly installed dustbins, which are barely a month old, were destroyed by angry protestors.
The protestors, who took to the streets on Thursday to demonstrate against the recent death of Albert Ojwang, were seen uninstalling the bins.
In videos seen by Kenyans.co.ke, a number of the bins were removed from their original posts, with the protestors carrying them along the road, as they dragged them along.
The bins were installed barely a month ago to help keep the city clean, as the county embarks on empowering a cleaner city.

Initially, when installed, the county had issued stern warnings to both city dwellers and hawkers against destroying them.
Speaking when the installation kicked off on Sunday, May 18, Nairobi County Chief Officer for Environment, Mosiria, stated that the bins were put in place to serve pedestrians, after the previously installed ones were stolen.
The bins were purely designated for Nairobians and pedestrians, with business owners sent a stern warning not to dump their commercial waste in the bins.
""Importantly, these dustbins are strictly meant for use by pedestrians and not for hawkers, vendors, or business owners,"" the county official had warned.
Nairobi residents had complained to the county that the city lacked bins, making it difficult for them to practice hygiene. After numerous complaints, the county heeded the pleas and installed the bins, which have now been destroyed.
The first batch of bins had been placed in high-traffic areas, with plans to expand into neighborhoods, parks, and transport hubs soon.
Governor Sakaja had emphasized that the bins were more than just waste containers but symbolized order, hygiene, and modernity in Nairobi.
To ensure the bins would be well taken care of and not destroyed, the county offered a Ksh5,000 reward to residents who reported cases of bin vandalism.
Condemning the vandalism, Mosiria acknowledged the youths' right to picket but urged them to exercise restraint, emphasizing that demonstrations should not be an excuse for destruction of property in the city.

UDA Politician Dies,"Nanam Ward MCA and UDA party member Philip Ekuwam Lomuria has died, the party has confirmed.
In a statement shared by the UDA Party Secretary-General, Hassan Omar, he confirmed that the lawmaker, who had also been serving as the Deputy Speaker of Turkana County, passed away, without providing the circumstances around his passing.
""Until his death, Lomuria, who also served as the Deputy Speaker of the Turkana County Assembly, was a staunch and dedicated member of the UDA Party, who exhibited zeal in undertaking his duties as a legislator at the County Assembly,"" the statement read in part. 
""As the family, the County Assembly, and indeed the residents of Turkana County mourn the loss of their loved one and leader, the UDA Party sends its sincere condolences and stands in solidarity with them at this time of grief.""

According to Turkana County Assembly Speaker Charles Ewoi, Ekuwam passed away while undergoing treatment at the hospital following an illness.
In his statement, Ewoi described the late Deputy Speaker as a dedicated and principled leader who served the people of Nanam Ward with distinction.
Ekuwam was first elected in 2013 and served as Deputy Speaker during his initial term. He was re-elected in 2022 and continued in the same capacity until his demise.
''His legacy of service, unity, and leadership will be remembered. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family, the people of Nanam Ward, and all who knew him,'' the Speaker stated.
On November 13, last year, UDA suffered another setback after losing one of its key MCAs in Murang’a. The MCA, Mark Wainaina, died while undergoing treatment for an ailment that had plagued him for a while.
Wainaina was diagnosed with a severe pulmonary disease that had caused his lungs to fail, prompting the family to take him to the hospital.
Wainana, who was a nominated MCA, was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at one of the hospitals after his condition worsened.
President William Ruto led other Kenyans and leaders in mourning the late Wainaina, describing him as a friendly and witty person with immense potential.

Govt Agency Intervenes After Woman Miscarries in Police Custody,"The National Gender and Equality Commission (NGEC) is demanding answers from the National Police Service (NPS) after reports of a pregnant woman suffering a miscarriage at seven months while in police custody.
In a statement on Thursday, June 12, the commission called for prompt investigations into the matter, accountability, and, ultimately, gender-responsive policing reforms to deter recurrence.
""A pregnant woman allegedly suffered a miscarriage while in police custody—an unconscionable tragedy that demands answers. The Commission calls for immediate investigation, accountability, and gender-responsive policing reforms,"" part of the statement read.
NGEC highlighted the importance of having systems that safeguard pregnant mothers in custody, emphasising that maternal health was a right that needed protecting.

To achieve this, the commission called for mandatory training of police officers on how to handle similar cases to minimise casualties in police custody. 
""Pregnancy should be protected, even behind bars. Maternal health must never be collateral damage in law enforcement processes,"" the statement read in part.
""Enough is enough. We must sensitise police officers—with data, training & empathy—on the rights of special interest groups. Fairness. Accountability. Dignity. Now. We urgently call on IPOA and NPS to launch swift, transparent investigations and ensure accountability.""
Reports of the woman miscarrying in custody broke on Wednesday, with her family revealing that she was seven months pregnant and had complained upon her booking at the station in Kinangop, Nyandarua County.
She had repeatedly been arrested after her employer filed a complaint saying that Ksh18,000 from a day's sales was missing. Later, it was discovered that only Ksh9,000 was missing, and the family managed to raise Ksh6,000.
Despite pleas by the family to the complainant to wait until the next day to come up with the remaining Ksh3,000, he refused to hear their complaints, and she was locked up for the night.
""I pleaded with the police to release my sister as we tried to raise the money on Wednesday, but they declined. I pleaded with them, informing them that my sister had other children waiting at home and we had a sick mother to take care of, but they refused,"" the victim's sister stated.
While in custody, she reportedly complained of severe abdominal pain and pleaded for medical attention, which was allegedly ignored by the officers.
At around 1 am, the victim called her sister to inform her that she needed assistance since she was bleeding heavily. She rushed to the station but was reportedly chased away.
Witnesses and family members claim that the woman began experiencing complications but was left unattended for hours, leading to the tragic loss of her pregnancy.
