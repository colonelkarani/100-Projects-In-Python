US Issues Warning After Protests in Nairobi CBD,"U.S. citizens have been warned against going to the Nairobi Central Business District (CBD) after protests took a chaotic turn on Thursday, June 12.
In a travel advisory, the United States Department of State cited the use of tear gas and live ammunition as an indication that the demonstrations pose a risk, particularly to American citizens.
""Violent protests are currently underway in the Central Business District (CBD) of Nairobi,"" the alert stated. ""Unverified reports have indicated the use of tear gas and live ammunition.""
As a result, the Bureau of Consular Affairs urged U.S. citizens currently in Kenya to exercise extreme caution and avoid the CBD until the situation stabilises.

Part of the cautionary measures U.S. citizens were urged to observe included avoiding crowds and notifying friends and family of their whereabouts at all times.
The bureau also advised its citizens to always carry their U.S. passport with a valid Kenyan visa in case they are required to present it to authorities.
Additionally, U.S. citizens were encouraged to follow local media for fresh developments and updates on the ongoing protests.
By Thursday afternoon, protests in the Nairobi CBD had escalated, forcing police to disperse an irate crowd using teargas canisters.
The demonstrations disrupted activities for most of the afternoon, with protestors turning up in their hundreds to rally around two main issues, the murder of blogger Albert Ojwang' and the 2025/2026 Budget, which was presented before Parliament by Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi.
Vandalism was also reported, with several newly installed bins removed from their original stations and carried along the roads by protestors, despite earlier warnings from the county government issued less than a month ago.
An unfortunate scene unfolded near Kenya Cinema, where two vehicles were set ablaze amid clashes between civilians and anti-riot police.
In its advisory, the U.S. also urged its citizens to keep their doors locked and windows rolled up while travelling in private vehicles.

Govt to Spend Ksh700M on New System to End Corruption,"The government has proposed an allocation of Ksh700 million towards the implementation of the Electronic Government Procurement (eGP) system.
Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi, while presenting the 2025/2026 budget estimates before the National Assembly, confirmed that the significant sum would go towards rolling out the programme, which is aimed at addressing and sealing corruption loopholes in procurement within government agencies.
''The government is committed to transparency and accountability in procurement. In this regard, I have proposed an allocation of Ksh700 million for rolling out the implementation of the Electronic Government Procurement (eGP),'' Mbadi announced.
The government has set the 2025/2026 budget at Ksh4.29 trillion, which it aims to finance through revenues, loans, and grants from financial partners.

The World Bank confirmed the government's new procurement system, eGP, was among the strict conditions it has placed for further loans to Kenya.  
The international lender told Bloomberg that it will unlock further financing for Kenya on the condition that President William Ruto's government implements wide-ranging economic reforms agreed on last year.
Meanwhile, the government is set to roll out the electronic procurement system in July, with 400 suppliers and national and county staff already trained.
With the rollout scheduled for July, all Kenyans seeking government tenders, bid bonds, procurement plans, tender evaluations, and budgetary allocations must use the eGP system.
The eGP platform was formally launched on April 7, 2025, at the Kenya School of Government. The system is aligned with the Digital Superhighway Agenda, which aims to deliver 80 per cent of public services online.
The system supports open contracting in compliance with international standards and enables full bid submission, evaluation, and contract award online.
Meanwhile, total revenue collections, including appropriation-in-aid for the 2025/2026 financial year, are projected at Ksh3.321 trillion.
Total expenditure is estimated at Ksh4.291 trillion, with Ksh3.134 trillion allocated to recurrent spending and Ksh693.2 billion set aside for development.
County governments are projected to receive a total allocation of Ksh474.9 billion.

KRA Introduces New Way of Filing Taxes as Deadline Nears,"Kenyans can now file their 'Nil returns' through eCitizen, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has revealed.
This marks a major shift by the authority as it seeks to simplify tax compliance among Kenyans, with the June 30 deadline fast approaching. The taxman is exploring more ways to offer taxpayers a simpler and more accessible way to meet their tax obligations.
“You can now file NIL returns on eCitizen; filing taxes has never been this easy. Use this and escape the commotion,” the statement read in part.
KRA has, however, clarified that as of now, only the Nil returns can be filed through the eCitizen.

Previously, all taxes, including the Nil returns, were exclusively filed through iTax; however, KRA has now integrated tax services into eCitizen, a platform widely used for government services.
KRA seeks to reduce system downtimes, which Kenyans usually experience, especially in the rush hours during the last days of tax filing. It is also aimed at making filing more user-friendly.
How to file Nil returns on eCitizen; 
Kenyans have been encouraged to visit the eCitizen portal, log in with their normal eCitizen credentials, and then go to eCitizen KRA.
After logging in, select KRA services and navigate to the tax filing section. In the section, choose Nil returns if you had no taxable income. Confirm details, including KRA pin and personal details, are correct.
After confirmation, click submit, and you will receive a confirmation message.
The taxman has assured Kenyans that the system is secure and that all tax records will be automatically updated upon submission.
The shift to eCitizen is part of KRA's broader strategy to modernise tax collection and increase compliance.
The authority noted that many Kenyans fail to file returns due to the complex processes on iTax, and eCitizen aims to simplify this.
This is also a move to centralise digital services in government, as it seeks to make eCitizen the go-to platform for accessing various, if not all, government functions under one umbrella.
Kenyans have until June 30 to file their taxes; failure to which could result in penalties. KRA has encouraged Kenyans to take advantage of the simplified process and ensure compliance before the deadline.

High Court Blocks Ruto’s Order on Public Seal Transfer,"The High Court has issued conservatory orders halting the implementation of the controversial transfer of the Public Seal from the Attorney General to the Head of Public Service.
Justice Chacha Mwita delivered the ruling on Thursday, June 12, stating that the transfer raised fundamental constitutional and legal issues of public importance that must be fully heard before any action is taken.
“A conservatory order is hereby issued restraining or stopping implementation of Executive Order No. 2 of 2023 to the extent that it purports to reorganise government and transfer the Public Seal from the custody of the Office of the Attorney General to the Head of Public Service in the Executive Office of the President, until further orders of the Court,” the judge ruled.
The court decision came barely 24 hours after lobby group Katiba Institute filed a petition on Wednesday. In the petition, they argued that Executive Order No. 2 of 2023 remained operational despite clearly violating the Constitution and the doctrine of separation of powers.
The Public Seal, December 8, 2023. PHOTO OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
Executive Order No. 2 of 2023 outlines the organisational structure of the Kenyan government, specifying the roles and responsibilities of various Ministries, State Departments, and Agencies.
In their petition, Katiba Institute argued that President William Ruto bypassed Parliament through the Executive Order, in what they termed a blatant power grab.
The transition of the Public Seal from the traditional custody of the Attorney General to the office of the Head of Public Service (HOPS) was facilitated by the National Assembly Administration Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2023. The bill proposed to amend the Office of the Attorney-General Act, 2012, effectively stripping the Attorney General of the authority to host the Seal.
Following a review of the petition, the High Court concluded that there were sufficient grounds to issue conservatory orders.
“This matter coming up for directions on the Notice of Motion and Petition… I am satisfied that the petition raises fundamental constitutional and legal matters of great public importance,” Justice Mwita stated in his written directive.
By issuing the conservatory orders, the High Court effectively blocked any implementation of the executive directive, specifically the transfer of the Public Seal, pending further court directions.
The Court also gave the petitioner seven days to file supplementary affidavits and written submissions not exceeding ten pages. The respondents will then have seven days to submit their responses.
The Public Seal plays a crucial role as a national symbol and a tool for authenticating official government documents. The Seal consists of the coat of arms of Kenya set on a grayscale background featuring two lions, a symbol of protection, holding spears and a traditional East African shield.
It serves as a mark of authenticity for key government documents, ensuring their legitimacy and official status. It is affixed to documents to confirm that they have been issued or approved by the state.
As a national symbol, it represents the authority of the Kenyan state and is a formal marker of sovereignty.

KHRC Shares Emergency Phone Numbers For Protestors,"Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC) has released special emergency phone numbers for people taking part in the ongoing protests.
The demonstrations began on Thursday, June 12, with a section of youths taking to the streets.
In response to the growing tension and demonstrations, KHRC urged protestors to keep emergency numbers close in case they are arrested or find themselves in danger.
“During today's protest and many more to come, please call these numbers if security officers arrest you or in case of an emergency,” KHRC said in a public statement.

Protestors are demanding justice following the death of blogger Albert Ojwang and are calling for the resignation of Deputy Inspector General Eliud Lagat.
Police were forced to lob tear gas canisters at youths protesting in Nairobi’s Central Business District to disperse the crowds.
The protestors marched through key locations, including City Hall, Moi Avenue, Harambee Avenue, Jeevanjee Gardens, and the Parliament buildings.
Many carried placards and waved flags while singing the national anthem and calling for Lagat to step down.
Despite tear gas being fired at them, protestors continued chanting. One placard read, “You cannot kill us and lead us.”
Videos and images obtained by Kenyans.co.ke showed some cars set on fire, although the fires were later extinguished.
Burning tyres were also seen on the roads. Business owners in the area were forced to close their shops for safety.
The phone numbers provided are from several organisations, including the Law Society of Kenya, Amnesty International, Defenders Coalition, KHRC, Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR), Civics Freedom Forum, and the Independent Medico-Legal Unit (IMLU).
These organisations are offering legal support, medical help, and rapid response services during the demonstrations.

Boniface Mwangi Faces Arrest,"Activist and photojournalist Boniface Mwangi risks arrest after failing to appear in court to answer charges of assaulting police officers.
According to the charge sheet, Mwangi is accused of assaulting two officers on separate occasions while they were discharging their official duties.
In the first count, he allegedly assaulted Sergeant Osman Omar on April 20 at the Metropolitan Court in the Kilimani area, Dagoretti Sub-County, Nairobi, causing actual bodily harm while the officer was on duty.
In a second count, Mwangi is accused of wilfully assaulting Police Constable Robert Oyola at the same location on April 2, also causing actual bodily harm.

Further, the activist faces an additional charge of using abusive language against Sergeant Omar on April 2 at the Metropolitan Court along Airwing Kodhek Road, Kilimani, with the intent to provoke a breach of peace.
Initially, in his official X account on Monday, April 21, Boni, as he is popularly known, claimed that the incident, which involved three officers from the Kilimani Police Station, happened on the night of Wednesday, April 2, where he claimed to have been assaulted.
According to Mwangi, the three officers approached him in his office, saying they were responding to an alleged noise complaint. One of the officers, who Mwangi claims was drunk and was chewing miraa, started roughing him up and, at some point, even attempted to shoot him with his firearm.
""I tried to ask the senior officer at the scene why the officer was working and carrying a firearm while intoxicated and chewing miraa. That’s when all hell broke loose, and a scuffle ensued,"" he narrated.
The court has directed that the matter be mentioned on July 14, adding to the latest challenges facing the activist. 
On May 22, Mwangi had to be airlifted to Nairobi for treatment after he could not walk properly after being tortured by Tanzanian Intelligence officers, following his trip to the East African nation. 
This was after he was found abandoned in Ukunda, Kwale County, which is approximately 92 kilometres north of the Tanzanian border at Lunga Lunga. The activist was deported by road from Dar es Salaam.
Speaking during a press briefing on Monday, June 2, Mwangi recalled being stripped naked, flogged, and even sodomised using objects during his time in captivity in Tanzania.
""They tied me upside down, and then they started beating my feet. I was screaming so hard, but no tears were coming out because of how painful it was. One of them suggested that they put underwear in my mouth, so they did. To drown my screams, they were playing gospel music,"" he narrated following the ordeal.
He was among the activists who travelled to Tanzania on May 19 to show solidarity with Tanzania's opposition leader Tundu Lissu, who is facing treason charges for calling for electoral reform.

Somali Parliament Staff to Get Attachments in Kenya's National Assembly,"National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang'ula has revealed that the government is set to offer attachment opportunities to Somali parliamentary personnel in the Kenyan Parliament.
In a statement on his official X account on Thursday, June 12, Wetang'ula claimed that the staff will soon be incorporated into various committees within the Kenyan National Assembly for practical, on-the-job learning experiences.
Additionally, the Speaker claimed that the Centre for Parliamentary Studies (CPST) will also facilitate more capacity-building programmes for the staff.
Wetang'ula has further proposed the formation of a Kenya-Somalia Parliamentary ""friendship"" group that will enable lawmakers from the two countries to have sustainable diplomatic engagements.

""In response to Speaker Madobe’s request, I affirmed Kenya’s readiness to support the capacity building of Somali parliamentary staff through training facilitated by Kenyan institutions such as the CPST and benchmarking programmes,"" Wetang'ula said.
""To further enhance this initiative, I assured the Ambassador that Somali parliamentary personnel would be attached to various committees within the Kenyan National Assembly for practical, on-the-job learning experiences,"" he added.
According to Wetang'ula, who revealed this after a meeting with the Somali Ambassador to Kenya, Jabril Ibrahim Abdulle, on Thursday, June 12, these efforts are aimed at strengthening diplomatic ties and cooperation between the two countries.
During the meeting, Wetang'ula stressed the need for integrating Somalia into the East African regional bloc, a move he asserted will be critical in catalysing the economic metamorphosis of the region.
""Reiterating my longstanding support for Somalia’s full membership in the East African Community (EAC), I emphasised the importance of Somalia’s integration into the regional bloc to promote collective development and stability across East Africa,"" he stated.
The announcement comes days after Kenya emphasised its commitment to Somalia’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence, in line with international law and regional agreements.
Acknowledging Kenya and Somalia's strong historical and cultural ties, the government assured that these foundations will continue to guide the two nations’ shared aspirations for peace, security, and sustainable development in the region.
""Kenya unequivocally recognises the authority of the Federal Government in Mogadishu as the sole and legitimate body responsible for administering the affairs of Somalia, including those of its regions,"" read a statement by the State Department of Foreign Affairs on Monday, May 26.

Standard Group CEO to Step Down After Brief Tenure,"The Standard Group CEO, Marion Gathoga-Mwangi, has announced that she will be stepping down from her role, barely a year after she took over the group's leadership on July 15, 2024.
Announcing her planned exit in the latest newsletter to the media house employees, she cited personal circumstances as the motivation for her exit and revealed that the transition process had already begun.
""To everything, however, there is a season, and a time for every purpose under the heavens. In this respect, therefore, personal circumstances that I cannot overlook have informed my decision on my future with the company,"" she wrote.
""Although I have not yet left, the transition has begun, and this may be the last newsletter I write to you. As I take this step, I ask for your prayers and well wishes.""

In the newsletter, Gathoga-Mwangi expressed immense gratitude to both the leadership and other employees at Standard Group for granting her support during her tenure, especially over the last couple of months.
“As we continue our journey of transformation, I want to take a moment to express my deep gratitude for the encouragement and support you have extended to me during this pivotal time,” the newsletter read.
“Over the past two months, I have found myself at a significant crossroads, one that has reminded me of the power of community, the importance of staying anchored in our values, and the role each of us plays in shaping the future of Standard Group PLC.”
She further highlighted several achievements made during her tenure, including completing the company's strategic plan to move to a 'business unusual' mode for long-term sustainability and shepherding the rights issue, a defining step towards stabilising our business in these turbulent times.
Other highlights she outlined were reducing operational costs, introducing the Continuous Improvement (CI) matrix, and, most importantly, solidifying a leadership team, led by Chaacha Mwita, that will safeguard the group's mission with clarity and purpose.
Gathoga-Mwangi took over the CEO position in July, replacing Joe Munene, who had held the position in an interim capacity since July 6, 2023.
Before joining Standard Group, she had served in various executive roles at The Linde Group PLC companies, such as African Oxygen Pty (AFROX) and BOC Kenya PLC, with her most notable contributions including enhancing access to medical gases across Africa and managing bulk and onsite manufacturing operations in South Africa.
She has yet to announce her next career move after her brief tenure at the media house, which has been grappling with financial instability for years now.

"Mosiria Goes After Mutura, Fish Vendors in Nairobi","Nairobi County has taken swift action against unsanitary food handling practices in Gikomba Market, shutting down some kiosks and issuing notices to seven other vendors over poor hygiene conditions.
The crackdown follows shocking revelations of fish vendors preparing and selling fish next to open urinals, raising serious public health concerns.
Nairobi County Chief Officer for Environment Geoffrey Mosiria led the crackdown along the Kombo Munyiri Road, where county officials uncovered filthy and unsafe food preparation areas.
In addition to the kiosk shutdowns, traders were warned that failure to improve hygiene standards would result in further closures.

""We found traders selling fish in extremely unhygienic environments, some even preparing food near areas used as open urinals. This is completely unacceptable, and we will take firm action against those endangering public health,"" Mosiria stated.
Further, the inspection also revealed poor handling of mutura, a city delicacy, which was being sold in conditions deemed unfit for consumption.
The county official warned the traders that reckless disregard for hygiene could lead to severe penalties, including business licence revocations.
""To make matters worse, the mutura being sold in the same vicinity was in a similarly filthy condition, posing a serious risk to public health. In response, we closed down two kiosks that were preparing and selling fish to innocent city residents under unsanitary conditions,"" Mosiria revealed.
Beyond food safety, traders were also warned against dumping waste into stormwater drainage systems, a habit they have adopted that is costing city dwellers by blocking waterways, causing flooding, and contributing to environmental pollution.
The city officials emphasised that hygiene practices in market areas directly affect both public health and environmental sustainability.
Mosiria further condemned the move by vendors who are paying street families Ksh50 to dispose of waste in illegal places, terming it as irresponsible and unlawful.
While encouraging the traders to use proper disposal channels, Mosiria revealed that this practice worsens garbage mismanagement in the city.
The county, which is hell-bent on ensuring hygiene practices are followed, has warned that it will be conducting regular inspections across major food markets to ensure compliance with hygiene regulations.
Businesses found violating standards will face closure or fines, as the county government works to protect consumers from contaminated food.

Newly Installed CBD Waste Bins Destroyed,"Nairobi County is counting losses after the newly installed dustbins, which are barely a month old, were destroyed by angry protestors.
The protestors, who took to the streets on Thursday to demonstrate against the recent death of Albert Ojwang, were seen uninstalling the bins.
In videos seen by Kenyans.co.ke, a number of the bins were removed from their original posts, with the protestors carrying them along the road, as they dragged them along.
The bins were installed barely a month ago to help keep the city clean, as the county embarks on empowering a cleaner city.

Initially, when installed, the county had issued stern warnings to both city dwellers and hawkers against destroying them.
Speaking when the installation kicked off on Sunday, May 18, Nairobi County Chief Officer for Environment, Mosiria, stated that the bins were put in place to serve pedestrians, after the previously installed ones were stolen.
The bins were purely designated for Nairobians and pedestrians, with business owners sent a stern warning not to dump their commercial waste in the bins.
""Importantly, these dustbins are strictly meant for use by pedestrians and not for hawkers, vendors, or business owners,"" the county official had warned.
Nairobi residents had complained to the county that the city lacked bins, making it difficult for them to practice hygiene. After numerous complaints, the county heeded the pleas and installed the bins, which have now been destroyed.
The first batch of bins had been placed in high-traffic areas, with plans to expand into neighborhoods, parks, and transport hubs soon.
Governor Sakaja had emphasized that the bins were more than just waste containers but symbolized order, hygiene, and modernity in Nairobi.
To ensure the bins would be well taken care of and not destroyed, the county offered a Ksh5,000 reward to residents who reported cases of bin vandalism.
Condemning the vandalism, Mosiria acknowledged the youths' right to picket but urged them to exercise restraint, emphasizing that demonstrations should not be an excuse for destruction of property in the city.

UDA Politician Dies,"Nanam Ward MCA and UDA party member Philip Ekuwam Lomuria has died, the party has confirmed.
In a statement shared by the UDA Party Secretary-General, Hassan Omar, he confirmed that the lawmaker, who had also been serving as the Deputy Speaker of Turkana County, passed away, without providing the circumstances around his passing.
""Until his death, Lomuria, who also served as the Deputy Speaker of the Turkana County Assembly, was a staunch and dedicated member of the UDA Party, who exhibited zeal in undertaking his duties as a legislator at the County Assembly,"" the statement read in part. 
""As the family, the County Assembly, and indeed the residents of Turkana County mourn the loss of their loved one and leader, the UDA Party sends its sincere condolences and stands in solidarity with them at this time of grief.""

According to Turkana County Assembly Speaker Charles Ewoi, Ekuwam passed away while undergoing treatment at the hospital following an illness.
In his statement, Ewoi described the late Deputy Speaker as a dedicated and principled leader who served the people of Nanam Ward with distinction.
Ekuwam was first elected in 2013 and served as Deputy Speaker during his initial term. He was re-elected in 2022 and continued in the same capacity until his demise.
''His legacy of service, unity, and leadership will be remembered. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family, the people of Nanam Ward, and all who knew him,'' the Speaker stated.
On November 13, last year, UDA suffered another setback after losing one of its key MCAs in Murang’a. The MCA, Mark Wainaina, died while undergoing treatment for an ailment that had plagued him for a while.
Wainaina was diagnosed with a severe pulmonary disease that had caused his lungs to fail, prompting the family to take him to the hospital.
Wainana, who was a nominated MCA, was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at one of the hospitals after his condition worsened.
President William Ruto led other Kenyans and leaders in mourning the late Wainaina, describing him as a friendly and witty person with immense potential.

Govt Agency Intervenes After Woman Miscarries in Police Custody,"The National Gender and Equality Commission (NGEC) is demanding answers from the National Police Service (NPS) after reports of a pregnant woman suffering a miscarriage at seven months while in police custody.
In a statement on Thursday, June 12, the commission called for prompt investigations into the matter, accountability, and, ultimately, gender-responsive policing reforms to deter recurrence.
""A pregnant woman allegedly suffered a miscarriage while in police custody—an unconscionable tragedy that demands answers. The Commission calls for immediate investigation, accountability, and gender-responsive policing reforms,"" part of the statement read.
NGEC highlighted the importance of having systems that safeguard pregnant mothers in custody, emphasising that maternal health was a right that needed protecting.

To achieve this, the commission called for mandatory training of police officers on how to handle similar cases to minimise casualties in police custody. 
""Pregnancy should be protected, even behind bars. Maternal health must never be collateral damage in law enforcement processes,"" the statement read in part.
""Enough is enough. We must sensitise police officers—with data, training & empathy—on the rights of special interest groups. Fairness. Accountability. Dignity. Now. We urgently call on IPOA and NPS to launch swift, transparent investigations and ensure accountability.""
Reports of the woman miscarrying in custody broke on Wednesday, with her family revealing that she was seven months pregnant and had complained upon her booking at the station in Kinangop, Nyandarua County.
She had repeatedly been arrested after her employer filed a complaint saying that Ksh18,000 from a day's sales was missing. Later, it was discovered that only Ksh9,000 was missing, and the family managed to raise Ksh6,000.
Despite pleas by the family to the complainant to wait until the next day to come up with the remaining Ksh3,000, he refused to hear their complaints, and she was locked up for the night.
""I pleaded with the police to release my sister as we tried to raise the money on Wednesday, but they declined. I pleaded with them, informing them that my sister had other children waiting at home and we had a sick mother to take care of, but they refused,"" the victim's sister stated.
While in custody, she reportedly complained of severe abdominal pain and pleaded for medical attention, which was allegedly ignored by the officers.
At around 1 am, the victim called her sister to inform her that she needed assistance since she was bleeding heavily. She rushed to the station but was reportedly chased away.
Witnesses and family members claim that the woman began experiencing complications but was left unattended for hours, leading to the tragic loss of her pregnancy.

Ruto Responds After EU Warning on Money Laundering in Kenya,"President William Ruto has pledged additional budgetary allocation to the investigating and prosecution agencies to fight money laundering.
Speaking during the closing ceremony of the Commonwealth Heads of Prosecuting Agencies Conference in Mombasa on Thursday, Ruto admitted that Kenya, just like any other nation, is faced with challenges in handling money laundering and other organised crimes.
''The government of Kenya remains committed to ensuring the rule of law and advancing a human-centred approach to prosecution and pursuit of justice. This conference has offered us an opportunity to respond to the emerging threats facing our country,'' Ruto stated.
''I look forward to your recommendations and assure you that the government of Kenya will support full empowerment and funding of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for their implementation effectively,'' he assured.

The Head of State further assured that Kenya was fully focused on revamping its anti-money laundering and asset forfeiture framework. 
''Importantly, the revamping of our anti-money laundering and asset forfeiture framework is a testament to our commitment. It reflects our pursuit of greater specialisation, stronger institutions, and high-quality investigations,'' Ruto added.
The developments come a day after the European Commission placed Kenya in its updated list of high-risk jurisdictions presenting strategic deficiencies in their national anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism regimes.
The Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that it had added a number of third-country jurisdictions to its list, including Algeria, Angola, Côte d'Ivoire, Kenya, Laos, Lebanon, Monaco, Namibia, Nepal and Venezuela.
The report means that Kenya and the affected countries have now entered the blacklist of the list of countries subject to extra monitoring of their money laundering controls.
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a Paris-based organisation that reviews efforts by more than 200 countries and jurisdictions to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing, compiles a ""grey list"" of nations that are subject to increased monitoring of financial transactions.
Meanwhile, Kenya’s Financial Reporting Centre has intensified the monitoring of suspicious financial transactions. The FRC has also expanded its scope of work with reporting institutions, especially banks, insurance firms, SACCOs, and forex bureaus, through real-time transaction monitoring and enhanced due diligence protocols.
Additionally, on Tuesday, the Director Investigations Bureau at DCI Headquarters, Abdalla Komesha, reaffirmed the detectives' commitment to investigating money laundering, terrorism financing, and major predicate offences, including organised crime.

Huge Win for Uhuru After Latest Court Ruling,"Former President Uhuru Kenyatta has emerged victorious in a legal battle that ended a long-running leadership dispute within the Jubilee Party.
The High Court, on Thursday, June 12, upheld the resolutions made during the party’s National Delegates Conference (NDC) held in May 2023, effectively validating Kenyatta’s leadership.
In March 2025, former Jubilee Chairman Nelson Dzuya supported the legitimacy of the NDC meeting. While he acknowledged that some procedural issues may have arisen, Dzuya affirmed that Kenyatta had the authority to convene the meeting and steer the party.
As a result of the court's ruling, Kenyatta was reinstated as the party leader, with leadership changes also confirmed at the top echelons of the party structure.

According to the court's ruling, Saitoti Torome has been confirmed as the new National Chairman of Jubilee, while Jeremiah Kioni retains his role as Secretary-General.
Lawyer Jackson Awele presented the formal application on behalf of the Jubilee faction led by Kenyatta, supported by a new legal team and the party’s Internal Dispute Resolution Committee (IDRC).
The judgment also nullified changes made by the rival group associated with former Kieni MP Kanini Kega and Sabina Chege, effectively stripping them of control over the party.
The conflict began after the Kega-Chege faction sought to oust Kenyatta’s allies, claiming the former president and his team had been removed and replaced through internal processes.
A previous ruling on September 30, 2024, had dismissed the recognition of Kenyatta's faction, temporarily handing control to the opposing group, a decision now overturned by the latest court verdict.
‘’Victory as the high court rules that the Jubilee Party belongs to Uhuru Kenyatta. Justice Janet Mulwa also nullified the Kanini-Sabina-led NEC that purported to remove Jeremiah Kioni, David Murathe, and Treasurer Kagwe Gichohi,’’ the statement by the party read in September 2024.
The court further ruled that David Murathe, the party’s Vice Chairperson, would legally retain his position despite attempts by the rival faction to expel him.
Kenyatta’s reinstatement now strengthens his standing in Kenya’s evolving political arena. Could it set the stage for a comeback? We can only wait and see.

Why DIG Lagat Has Not Resigned - Kanja Explains,"Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja has clarified why Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Eliud Lagat had not resigned amid mounting public pressure and ongoing investigations into the controversial death of blogger Albert Ojwang.
Appearing before the National Assembly Committee on National Security, IG Kanja explained that the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) was currently conducting an independent investigation into the matter, and the next action against Lagat would depend on the outcome.
""There is an ongoing investigation by IPOA. Every person whose name will be mentioned as having played any role that led to the death of the late Albert Ojwang must record a statement,"" Kanja said.
Kanja insisted that it would be improper for the DIG to be forced to vacate office based solely on public pressure or speculation.

The DIG clarified that if evidence implicated DIG Lagat in the ongoing probe, it would lead to action from the National Police Service. ""If the DIG is mentioned, he will step aside,"" he added.
Lagat has been under fire in recent days in the wake of Ojwang's passing, particularly after it emerged that the DIG was the complainant in a case that led to the arrest of the blogger in Homa Bay.
On Wednesday, Kanja revealed details of the alleged posts that DIG Lagat had reported. He stated that the account, which had over 13,000 followers, had allegedly published false information accusing the DIG of involvement in corruption within the National Police Service.
Lagat was a notable absentee from the parliamentary proceedings on Thursday, although his counterpart, Deputy Inspector General Gilbert Masengeli, attended alongside DCI boss Mohamed Amin.
Meanwhile, several petitioners took matters into their own hands on Wednesday by filing a petition at the Milimani Law Court, seeking to initiate private prosecution proceedings against Lagat.
In their petition, the petitioners criticised investigative agencies for failing to take appropriate action regarding the controversy surrounding the death of Ojwang.
Meanwhile, the Nairobi Central Business District saw normal service disrupted on Thursday after hundreds of youth stormed the streets demanding the resignation of Lagat.
The protests threatened to cripple major operations within the CBD, as Kenyans awaited the reading of the 2025/2026 Budget by Treasury CS John Mbadi.

Meta Reveals How Kenya Govt Tried to Access Facebook User Data,"New data by Meta revealed that Kenya was the leading country in East Africa for requesting user data, making 35 requests targeting 55 accounts in 2024.
Compared to its neighbouring countries, this was a high figure, with Uganda making only two requests, Tanzania and Sudan making one each, while Somalia and Ethiopia made none at all.
In the report, Meta revealed that it responds to government requests for data in accordance with applicable law and its terms of service. According to Meta, after receiving the requests, it carefully reviews them for legal sufficiency and may decide to either reject or adhere to the requests.
“Every request we receive is carefully reviewed for legal sufficiency, and we may reject or require greater specificity on requests that appear overly broad or vague,” the report reads in part.

Meta allows governments to request data through legal process requests and emergency disclosure requests.
Legal requests are those from governments accompanied by a legal process, such as a search warrant.
In emergencies, law enforcement may submit requests without legal process. Based on the circumstances, Meta may voluntarily disclose information to law enforcement where they have a good-faith reason to believe that the matter involves an imminent risk of serious physical injury or death.
The data shared upon request includes name, email, phone number, IP address, login history, timestamps, public posts, comments, likes, and device usage.
Between January and June, the government made 23 requests targeting 37 accounts. This was during the period when the government faced retaliation from the youth over the Finance Bill 2024. The retaliations culminated in protests that led to Gen Z storming Parliament.
Between July and December, the government made 12 requests targeting 18 accounts. This was after the protests, and Kenyans began to witness increased cases of forced disappearances, with youths being abducted over contrary opinions they had posted online.
The revelations have sparked concerns about digital privacy and government surveillance, especially as Kenya moves to expand its monitoring capabilities.
A recent budget allocation revealed that the government has set aside Ksh150 million for the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) to procure and operate Optimus 3.0, a system designed to track social media users.

How KRA Plans to Increase Tax Compliance in Private Sector,"The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has adopted a collaborative approach with the Kenya Private Sector Alliance (KEPSA) to bolster voluntary tax compliance in the private sector.
According to a statement on June 12, the two entities recently held a high-level meeting seeking lasting solutions to enhance voluntary compliance, expand the tax base and build a predictable business environment through structured dialogue.
As a result, they agreed on the need to formalise joint technical working groups to address sector-specific tax challenges, develop taxpayer education programs for SMEs, and advance the mutual goal of simplifying the tax regime.
To boost compliance and bring more businesses into the formal fold, they committed to regular quarterly engagements and a shared monitoring framework to track progress on agreed actions.

The next joint forum is expected to focus on taxation in the digital economy, customs reforms, and investment incentives for the priority sector.
Speaking at the engagement, KRA board chairperson Ndiritu Muriithi highlighted the critical role of KEPSA in driving this compliance, highlighting the importance of such trusted partnerships.
“KEPSA plays a vital role in representing a cross-section of the private sector. Through structured engagement and shared insights, we can co-create solutions that ease compliance, unlock new revenue streams, and ultimately drive economic growth,” he said.
In his remarks, KEPSA Chairman Dr Jas Bedi backed Muriithi's sentiments, welcomed the partnership agreement, and asserted that the sector was a willing ally in strengthening the nation's fiscal framework.
“We appreciate KRA’s openness to continuous dialogue. This engagement ensures that tax reforms are practical, predictable and in alignment with the realities businesses face on the ground,” he said.
The move formed part of KRA's plan to expand the active taxpayer base from the then 9 million to 13 million by 2027, while simultaneously enhancing trust and transparency through stakeholder engagement.
As such, KEPSA pledged to support the efforts by mobilising its membership base for outreach, feedback, and policy dialogue forums.
It also commended KRA for the recent tax amnesty initiative, which provided a fresh start for businesses and individuals seeking to regularise their tax affairs.

"Tear Gas, Chaos in Nairobi CBD as Protesters Demand Justice for Ojwang","Hundreds of youth stormed the streets of Nairobi's central business district on Thursday, June 12, demanding the resignation of Deputy Inspector General Eliud Lagat.
The protests threatened to cripple major operations within the CBD, as Kenyans awaited the reading of the 2025/2026 Budget by Treasury CS John Mbadi.
Protesters marched through key areas including City Hall, Jeevanjee Gardens, and Parliament Buildings.
They also occupied critical roads such as Harambee Avenue, signalling attempts to breach the security perimeter around Parliament.

Police responded by dispersing the crowds using tear gas canisters and other crowd-control tactics.
The protestors, some donned in Kenyan flag colours, sang in unison as they demanded the resignation of the DIG over the death of influencer Albert Ojwang while in police custody.
Additionally, images and videos obtained by Kenyans.co.ke showed protestors waving placards bearing messages directed at authorities, blowing whistles, and carrying twigs.
In a bid to curb the influx of more youth into the city centre, road users along Thika Road reported heightened security checks, with officers conducting thorough inspections to limit the number of vehicles accessing the CBD.
By the time of publishing, a heavy police presence, particularly anti-riot officers in full gear, had been deployed across the city to repel the demonstrators, working alongside their regular police counterparts.
Despite the show of force, the protestors remained defiant, continuing their march across various streets within the CBD.
Meanwhile, the situation in the city centre at the time of publishing was marked by running battles and heavy use of tear gas, as police remained determined to ensure that the budget procession from the Treasury building to Parliament proceeded without disruption.
This unfolded even as the top leadership of the National Police Service (NPS), led by Inspector General Douglas Kanja and DCI boss Mohamed Amin, appeared before the National Assembly’s Departmental Committee on Administration and Internal Security to respond to queries over the death of Ojwang.

Duale Issues Notice to All County Governments,"Health Cabinet Secretary, Aden Duale, has urged all County Governments to collect the over 6 million vaccine doses from regional depots.
Duale flagged off 3 million doses of BCG and 3.2 million doses of Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) on Thursday, June 12, in a bid to address the recent vaccine shortage the country has experienced.
Speaking during the flag-off ceremony, the CS said that governors should ensure the swift collection and supply of the vaccines to all healthcare facilities without delay. The CS noted that facilities in remote and underserved areas should be prioritised during the exercise.
Duale asserted that the swift supply of these vaccines, which will be at the regional depots before the end of the week, will be critical in ensuring that children's vaccination services return to normalcy.

""With today's vaccines now in the country, I'm calling upon all the County Governments through the Council of Governors and the County Executive Committee members for health to give priority in the collection of these vaccines from our regional depots and ensure that distribution to health facilities is facilitated,"" Duale stated.
""The vaccines will reach our regional vaccine stores by the end of this week, and I urge the county health teams to act without delay so that we can fully restore the routine immunisation across the country,"" he added.
The health boss has further urged parents and guardians to remain vigilant and ensure that they visit the nearest healthcare facilities to have their children vaccinated and catch up on any missed doses.
Duale has also urged Kenyans to immediately get in touch with the ministry, through relevant health authorities, if they experience any vaccine stockouts or a delay in vaccine services.
""I call upon our parents and guardians to remain always vigilant and to be in the first line of the public health support team. We will all ensure that no child in our country is left behind in our immunisation programs,"" he said.
On the other hand, the ministry has raised concerns about an emerging global shortage of the Rotavac Frozen vaccine, which is used to protect children against diarrhoea, a shortage that is expected to escalate from the second quarter of 2025, according to the CS.
According to the CS, the ministry is on high alert and is preparing healthcare workers on how to manage the situation once the shortage of vaccines intensifies.
""As I noted last week, the country and indeed the world is grappling with the global disruption of the vaccine supply chain, but despite these challenges, the government of Kenya remains steadfast in its mission to uphold every child's rights to immunisation,"" the CS said.

Over 100 Families Displaced After Night Fire Destroys Homes in Nairobi,"More than 100 families were forced to sleep in the cold on Wednesday night after a fire in Nairobi's Kibra estate.
Traders and homeowners bore the biggest brunt of the incident after the fire spread to their units, leaving them counting losses.
Residents have reported that efforts to extinguish the fire were hampered by narrow roads, which prevented fire engines from accessing the scene.
Public Service CS Geoffrey Ruku also visited the scene in the company of local leaders, including the area MP Peter Orero, who promised to release emergency aid to support them.

''Incidents of fires have become very common in informal settlements,  especially in Nairobi. The government is committed to ending these tragedies to protect the lives and property of citizens,'' Ruku said.
''Early this morning, I visited Mukungu village in Kibra, Nairobi, to support victims of a fire that left several families homeless. The government will provide emergency relief aid to the families to assist them in getting their lives back on track.''
Last month, on May 24, six people died while 20 others suffered severe injuries after a fire incident in Makina.
While confirming the fire, the area Orero revealed that it occurred behind Kambi along the route to Eagles and affected over 40 households.
Among the injured were one man, two women, and three children, all of whom were rushed to the hospital for treatment.
Meanwhile, the latest fire adds to a string of similar incidents in Nairobi, including a deadly blaze on May 19 in Mathare B slums that claimed five lives, three adults and two children. At least four others were left in critical condition during the tragedy.
Separately, the government has often cited the Affordable Housing agenda as a long-term solution to the recurring fire tragedies in informal settlements.
CS Ruku echoed this position, stating, ""The affordable housing projects in informal settlements spearheaded by President William Ruto are a sustainable solution to such incidents and will ensure the government protects the lives and properties of Kenyans while providing humane and decent living environments.""

How Kenya Stands to Gain From China’s Zero-Tariff Deal,"Kenya is set to enjoy zero tariff treatment if a proposed partnership between China and 53 African countries is agreed.
In a letter to ministers of the Forum on China–Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), Chinese President Xi Jinping said that it would be available once the leaders of the continent negotiate and sign the agreement of China-Africa Economic Partnership for Shared Development.
President Jinping identified two main areas of opportunity: first, to deepen the implementation of the ten partnership actions for modernisation, and second, to strengthen cooperation in key projects.""
He stated that cooperation in the green industry, e-commerce and e-payment, science and technology, and artificial intelligence, along with enhanced security, finance, and rule of law initiatives, would promote the high-quality development of China-Africa cooperation.
An image of Chinese and Kenyan officials during the signing of seven deals by Chinese companies that intend to invest in Kenya with new projects. PCS
Citing the current global challenges, such as the tariffs imposed by United States President Donald Trump, he emphasised that China was committed to providing new opportunities for the world.
If signed, the agreement would bring significant economic benefits to Kenya. The most immediate and obvious advantage is that Kenyan products would enter the vast Chinese market without being subjected to import duties.
This would effectively lower the cost of Kenyan goods for Chinese consumers and businesses, making them more competitive. As a result, export volumes, particularly for agricultural products, manufactured goods, and other commodities, could rise significantly.
Additionally, a zero-tariff policy would provide room for export diversification, enabling the country to trade in more value-added goods.
Beyond this, such a policy could spur economic growth and job creation, as increased exports would generate higher revenues for businesses, potentially stimulating production, investment, and employment across various sectors.
Moreover, the promise of easier access to the Chinese market could make Kenya a more attractive destination for Chinese foreign direct investment, especially in export-oriented industries.
However, despite the potential benefits, key concerns remain. These include increased competition and product quality issues, the risk of a skewed trade balance, and persistent non-tariff barriers, all of which could hinder the full realisation of the policy’s advantages.
Also, Kenya’s diplomatic relations with the US, which imposes tariffs on the nation, will be under heightened scrutiny as China is America’s greatest global competitor.
The latest comes after President William Ruto's China tour in April, where he struck seven deals worth Ksh100.1 billion ($773M) in areas such as tourism, manufacturing, and agriculture.

Kenya Bags Key International Seat in Competitive Global Vote,"Kenya will be taking part in key global travel policies after it was elected to the UN Tourism Executive Council for the 2025–2029 term.
Kenya beat Thailand and Malta in the highly contested elections, marking a major milestone in the country's global tourism leadership. The victory was announced at the Second UN Tourism Africa and Americas Ministerial Summit held in Livingstone, Zambia.
""Kenya is honoured to have been elected to the UN Tourism Executive Council for the 2025–2029 term, following a highly contested election,"" Tourism and Gender CS Rebecca Miano said in an official statement.
The election to the UN Tourism Executive Council is a major diplomatic and economic victory for Kenya that will have a far-reaching impact on the tourism sector.

The council is the highest decision-making organ within the organisation, second only to the General Assembly. It plays a crucial role in ratifying key policies before they are adopted globally.
Kenya's membership in the council also provides a powerful platform to champion progressive tourism strategies, focusing on inclusivity, sustainability, and digital transformation.
Beyond the prestige, the role also comes with other goodies for the country, including air connectivity, visa accessibility, and eco-friendly tourism development.
The CS emphasised that the country will advocate for easier travel policies that promote cross-border tourism and boost visitor numbers in Africa.
""This reflects our continued commitment to global tourism leadership and regional cooperation,"" Miano assured.
Already, Kenya is an active member of several key committees within UN Tourism. These platforms have enabled the country to push for innovative solutions, including enhanced digital adoption in travel and tourism.
The election outcome signifies Kenya's growing reputation in global tourism leadership. The country has continuously invested in initiatives such as community-based tourism, wildlife conservation, and heritage preservation, making it a model for sustainable tourism practices across Africa.
Kenya has now committed to contributing to a more inclusive and sustainable tourism future as it steps into its new role. Kenyans, including leaders, have hailed the Ministry for landing the role.

"Inside New 'Bolt Comfort' With Air-Conditioning, High-Rated Drivers & 5-Minute Pick-up Times","Kenyans are set to enjoy a new, one-of-a-kind driving experience by Bolt after the ride-hailing platform launched “Bolt Comfort”, a new ride category designed to meet growing demand for high-quality transport services among Nairobi’s expanding middle class and professional commuters.  
In the new package, passengers are set to experience a new service tier offering spacious, newer-model vehicles, 2016 and above, mandatory air-conditioning, and access to top-rated drivers (4.8+ rating). 
Unlike Standard rides, where amenities like air conditioning are not guaranteed, Comfort mandates it, alongside regular third-party vehicle inspections every six months via AutoExpress, ensuring a consistently high-quality experience.
Drivers enrolled in the Comfort category benefit from improved earning potential through higher fare rates, and only those with a strong performance record (rating of 4.8+) qualify, raising the overall service standard for both riders and drivers.

The category targets passengers who expect more comfort, professionalism, and reliability in their everyday transport, ideal for business commutes, airport runs, client meetings, and formal engagements.
With this in mind, Bolt assures that passengers who are willing to pay a modest premium are guaranteed a more refined and consistent travel experience.
Despite the added features, Bolt Comfort remains around 13 per cent more affordable than similar offerings in the market, making it one of the best value-for-comfort options available in Kenya.
This strategic move is part of Bolt’s broader effort to diversify its offerings, attract new premium passengers, and increase overall trip value in an evolving urban mobility landscape.
“Keeping our services affordable remains central to how we operate at Bolt,” said Dimmy Kanyankole, General Manager for Bolt Kenya and Tanzania.

 “With Bolt Comfort, we’re building on that foundation by offering a premium, yet accessible, option for riders seeking a higher level of service. Our research shows a strong appetite among corporate and middle-income passengers for ride options that offer comfort, reliability, and professionalism. Bolt Comfort is designed to meet exactly that demand.”
The service will be initially available in high-demand areas within Nairobi and its environs, including Nairobi CBD, Westlands, Kilimani, and Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA). Bolt plans to expand the category citywide, extending to Kiambu County by December 2025, with a target fleet size of 1,000+ Comfort vehicles.
Further, Bolt projects that the Comfort category could account for up to 10 per cent of total rides by 2025, driven by uptake from passengers willing to pay a modest premium for a more refined and consistent travel experience. 
They cited Kenya’s middle class, which now accounts for nearly 45 per cent of the population according to the African Development Bank (AfDB), and continues to drive demand for better quality services in sectors ranging from housing to mobility. 
Nairobi, in particular, is experiencing a surge in professionals, entrepreneurs, and corporate employees who require transport solutions that reflect their evolving lifestyle and business needs.
Bolt Comfort is now available in the Bolt app. Riders can select the Comfort category when booking to experience elevated everyday travel.

KeNHA to Close Section of Mombasa Road This Weekend,"A section of Mombasa Road will be temporarily closed this weekend to facilitate ongoing installation works, the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) has announced.
In a public notice, KeNHA revealed Mombasa-bound service lanes near Naivas JKIA would be closed from Saturday, June 14, at 9:00 pm to Sunday, June 15, at 10:00 am.
“The Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) wishes to notify the public that a section of Mombasa Road (A8) near Naivas JKIA will experience traffic disruption along the Mombasa-bound service lanes from Saturday, June 14, 2025, at 9:00 pm to Sunday, June 15, 2025, at 10:00 am,” a statement from KeNHA read.
The authority also revealed details of the construction works, saying the closure would facilitate the installation of fabricated beams for the Syokimau Railway Footbridge.

These beams are crucial, particularly because they enhance pedestrian connectivity and safety along the busy Mombasa Road.
Because of the partial closure, motorists have been advised to exercise caution during the affected hours and adhere to traffic officials who will be on site throughout the exercise. Normal traffic is expected to resume once installation is complete.
For those who typically use the Mombasa-bound service lanes, they will have to divert to the main Mombasa Road for a few hundred metres until the Gateway Mall overpass.
Similarly, motorists who typically use the service lane to access the Gateway Mall overpass may be required to seek alternative routes to avoid the working area as the beams are being erected.
This marks the latest hours-long disruption by KeNHA on a major Nairobi road, as the authority continues its strategy of carrying out road works on weekend nights when traffic is at its lowest.
The Southern bypass was also subjected to a similar closure near the entrance of the China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) camp, directly opposite the Nairobi National Park.
The disruption lasted 8 hours between Saturday, June 7, and Sunday, June 8, to facilitate the installation of stress-strain sensors on the road surface. The sensors are highly specialised instruments embedded into the pavement structure to measure how pavement materials respond to various physical forces.
In April, a temporary closure of a section of Mombasa Road and the Nairobi Expressway near Katani Road was also announced between Saturday, April 19, and Sunday, July 20.

Outrage After Woman Loses Pregnancy at Police Station,"A family is demanding justice after a young woman reportedly suffered a miscarriage while detained at a local police post in Kinangop, Nyandarua County.
Her sister revealed that she was seven months pregnant and complained upon her booking at the station.
She was reportedly arrested after her employer filed a complaint saying Ksh18,000 from a day's sales was missing.
""I pleaded with the police to release my sister as we tried to raise the money on Wednesday, but they declined. I pleaded with them, informing them that my sister had other children waiting at home and we had a sick mother to take care of, but they refused,"" Wangui said.

Later, it was discovered that only Ksh9,000 was missing, prompting friends and family to mobilise funds.
They managed to raise Ksh6,000, promising to raise the additional Ksh3,000 in the morning, but the police and the complainant rejected it, demanding the full amount.
During her time in custody, she reportedly complained of severe abdominal pain and pleaded for medical attention, which was allegedly ignored by the officers.
The family revealed that at around 1 am, the victim called her sister to inform her that she needed assistance since she was bleeding heavily.
However, upon arrival, officers reportedly chased the sister away, denying her access.
Witnesses and family members claim that the woman began experiencing complications but was left unattended for hours, leading to the tragic loss of her pregnancy.
""I came back to the station early in the morning, but I was still denied access to her. But I was still denied access to her, but learned that she had suffered a miscarriage during the night and had remained in the police cell,"" the sister narrated.
The incident sparked uproar, drawing the attention of Nyandarua Senator John Methu, who called for speedy investigations into the matter.

Govt to Install CCTV Cameras After Recommendations,"CCTV cameras are set to be installed at Nyayo Stadium as part of a wider effort to improve security, in line with recommendations from the Confederation of African Football (CAF).
Sports Cabinet Secretary Salim Mvurya confirmed the move on Wednesday, June 11, amid the ongoing national conversation about the role of surveillance in ensuring public safety and accountability.
According to the CS, the installation is part of the final phase of renovations aimed at aligning Nyayo with CAF standards, ahead of the CHAN Championship set for August.
“The most important thing is that we're strengthening, we're beautifying, and we're enhancing with CCTV gadgets after it is completed,” said Mvurya.

The CS further noted that work across various stadiums is now more than 80 per cent complete, with less than 15 weeks to the start of the continental competition.
In addition, Mvurya also revealed that CAF had recommended the rebuilding of the perimeter wall around Nyayo Stadium, citing security concerns.
The decision to introduce CCTV and upgrade the stadium’s perimeter wall follows several CAF-monitored test matches at the venue, including one featuring the Harambee Stars.
With large crowds expected during international events, CAF is insistent that having reliable, high-quality surveillance is no longer optional. Surveillance cameras are particularly crucial in managing queues, monitoring entry points, and ensuring stewards are effectively deployed during match days.
On the other hand, an unscaled perimeter wall can act as a deterrent to crime, particularly after scenes which were witnessed on March 23, 2025, during the World Cup qualifier match between Kenya and Gabon, when hundreds of fans damaged infrastructure to gain entry to the venue.
As the government battles against time to ensure all designated facilities are ready for the second most prestigious tournament in Africa after the Africa Cup of Nations, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) continues to send officials to inspect progress and deliver reports.
During one of the latest assessments on May 28, CAF Secretary General Veron Mosengo sounded the alarm to Sports Cabinet Secretary Salim Mvurya, cautioning that failure by Kenya to execute CHAN effectively would put the country, and Africa in general, at risk.
According to Mosengo, a sub-standard tournament would effectively jeopardise stakeholders’ and investors’ confidence in Kenya and Africa in hosting continental events.

IEBC Official on the Spot Over Fake Degree,"The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) has arrested five public officials, including an Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) official, in an ongoing crackdown on fake academic certificates.
The suspects, who are employees or former employees of various public institutions, are accused of using falsified academic qualifications to secure employment and/or promotions, resulting in the fraudulent acquisition of public funds amounting to tens of millions of shillings.
Through a statement, EACC disclosed the arrests, which involved other government institutions, including the Kenya Rural Roads Authority (KeRRA), the National Syndemic Diseases Control Council (NSDCC), the Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC), and the Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company (NCWSC).
As for the IEBC official, she was arrested for allegedly forging a Bachelor of Science degree in Human Resource Management, purporting it to have been issued by the Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology (MMUST).

She was arraigned at the Milimani Anti-Corruption Court, where she was charged with various offences, including forgery and uttering a false document. She denied the charges and was released on a cash bail of Ksh200,000 or an alternative bond of Ksh800,000.
In the case of NSDCC, the official was accused of forging a Bachelor of Arts degree in Social Work from the University of Nairobi. The forged certificate was allegedly used to secure employment at the Council. As a result, the accused fraudulently received Ksh16,495,296.72 in salaries.
He was scheduled to be arraigned in court on Wednesday, June 11, and will face charges of fraudulent acquisition of public funds, deceiving a principal, forgery, and uttering a false document.
In the case of KeRRA, the accused was a former Deputy Director and allegedly used forged academic credentials to secure employment and maintain her position.
Further investigations revealed that she presented a forged Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) and later submitted another forged degree in Business Administration from Kenya Methodist University during internal disciplinary proceedings.
As a result, the suspect fraudulently received Ksh40,329,379.65 in salaries. The official was arrested yesterday and is set to appear in court today. She will face charges of fraudulent acquisition of the salaries, deceiving a principal, forgery, and uttering false documents.
In the case of KMTC, the official, a former driver, was arrested for allegedly forging a Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) certificate. The forged certificate was allegedly used to gain employment at KMTC in 2018.
After his arrest, he was released on a cash bail of Ksh50,000 and is set to appear in court on Monday, June 16.
In the same breath, a driver at NCWSC is on the spot for allegedly forging a KCSE certificate to gain employment and fraudulently earn Ksh6,742,673.00 in salaries based on the forged qualifications.
He was arrested on Tuesday, June 10, and later released on a cash bail of Ksh100,000. He is set to be arraigned on Monday, June 16, on charges of fraudulent acquisition of public property, forgery, and uttering false documents.
In addition to the criminal proceedings, EACC announced it would initiate civil recovery processes in court to recover all salaries, allowances, and benefits fraudulently acquired by the suspects.

Ruto Faces First Major Hurdle After IEBC Appointments,"Two petitioners have made a last-ditch effort to stop the appointment of new commissioners for the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission with a letter to Chief Justice Martha Koome.
The move came barely hours after President William Ruto appointed Erastus Edung Ethekon as the Chairperson of the IEBC for a term of six years, alongside five other commissioners.
In their letter to Koome, the petitioners questioned the legality of the gazettement of the new chair and commissioners and faulted the President for allegedly bypassing the Judiciary with his move.
While the appointments were made under the powers granted to the President under Article 250(2) of the Constitution, alongside Section 5(2) and Paragraph 4 of the First Schedule to the IEBC Act, questions were raised on the legality of the appointments, especially since conservatory orders had been issued on May 19.

The court orders effectively blocked vetting and approval of Ruto's IEBC picks, pending the determination of a separate petition filed by two individuals.
""In a strange twist of events and in utter disregard of conservatory orders issued by the Milimani Court, the President on June 10 contentiously gazetted and pursuant to such gazettment appointed the interested parties,"" the petitioners' letter read in part.
While the gazettement of the commissioners is legally binding and formalises the appointment, Edung Ethekon and his commissioners cannot perform their duties until they are sworn in.
The petitioners are hoping to bank on this loophole, as they appealed to the CJ to refrain from swearing in Ruto's appointees.
""Your ladyship, the Judiciary remains the last bastion of hope in upholding the rule of law and constitutionalism. Vide this letter, we humbly urge your good office and the judiciary as a whole not to participate in any oath taking and assumption of office by the interested parties until the subject of the petition is heard and determined as was so ordered,"" the letter went on.
Since the High Court's orders still stand in effect, it remains to be seen whether the swearing-in can proceed amid a constitutional challenge.
Legal experts weighed in on the gazettement, terming it a gross violation of the Constitution, a move they say could see the matter return to court with a fresh legal challenge.
If Koome proceeds with the swearing-in, the new IEBC chair and his commissioners will officially begin their term, which is supposed to run for six years.

OCS Talaam Breaks Silence on Albert Ojwang Murder Accusations,"“It was not me.” Officer Commanding Station at Central Police Station, Samson Talaam, has denied being the prime suspect in Albert Ojwang's murder.
While giving his account to the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA), Talaam recounted that on the day of Ojwang's death, he was brought into the station in critical condition.
According to his account, given on Wednesday, June 11, Talaam and fellow officers attempted to save his life. They even rushed the late Ojwang to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.
He further added that, contrary to reports, he did not object to Ojwang's booking at the station.

The OCS disclosed that he was not at the station when Ojwang was brought in but arrived after he was notified of Ojwang's critical state.
Talaam's remarks came after the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) boss, Mohammed Amin, pointed an accusing finger at him, adding that he should be treated as the main suspect in the popular influencer's killing.
Speaking before the Senate yesterday, Amin identified Talaam as the individual most responsible for Ojwang's death, which occurred on Sunday, June 8.
Amin noted that Talaam had declined to book Ojwang upon his arrival at Central Police Station.
“It has further been confirmed that before the booking, the report office personnel called the OCS, who declined to book the suspect. Talaam is the Officer Commanding Central Police Station,"" he stated.
""Talaam is the OCS of Central Police Station, and by the totality of things, he should be treated as the prime suspect in this matter,"" Amin stated.
After news of Ojwang's murder broke and details of Central Police Station's role in the incident emerged, Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja interdicted Talaam and five others.
Aside from Talaam, other interdicted officers included the deputy OCS, the deputy non-commissioned officer, crime aid officer, cell sentry officer, and report office personnel.
