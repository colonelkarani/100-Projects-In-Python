Ruto Reveals Town That Could be Kenya’s Next City,"President William Ruto has announced his intention to make Meru town Kenya’s fifth city after Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, and Nakuru.
The Head of State, while addressing a roadside rally at Makutano Junction, Meru town, on Saturday afternoon, said he was ready to elevate the municipality to city status due to its rapid growth.
In his speech, the President revealed the government’s plan to disburse Ksh2 billion for the construction of 16 additional modern markets to boost trade.
""The governor has said he wants Meru to become Kenya's next city. Do you want Meru to become the next city? So, do you think I did not know that? I already had that idea in mind,"" Ruto said.

During the rally, Ruto also ordered Water and Sanitation Cabinet Secretary Eric Mugaa to ensure the county's sewer system was rectified by December this year.
He noted the market and sewer projects were part of the broader plan to enhance Meru's ability to attract investment and spur further development in the region.
Ruto's promise follows a request by Meru Governor Isaac Mutuma, who called on the president to consider making the populous region a city as an appreciation of the town's growth.
Mutuma, in his request to the Head of State, revealed that several development projects had already been completed and that elevating Meru to city status would be an added advantage.
""Our big problem, which was the sewer system in Meru, will be completed so that the next city in Kenya becomes Meru. We want the next city to be clean once the sewer system has been rectified,"" Mutuma told the President.
Meanwhile, Ruto's plan to make Meru the next city comes four years after the government made Nakuru a city following a vote by the Senate to elevate it from municipality.
Former President Uhuru Kenyatta, in November 2021, formally awarded a city charter to Nakuru, making it Kenya's fourth city. It was made a city mainly because of its population growth and economic development. 
For a town to become a city, it must have a population of at least 250,000 residents, have a city development plan and prove its ability to generate revenue to sustain its operations.

Family of Shot Mask Vendor Issues Alarming Health Update,"The family of Boniface Kariuki, the mask vendor who was shot during the June 17 protests in Nairobi, has revealed that he is in a bad state and not responding to treatment.
Speaking during a media briefing on Saturday outside Kenyatta National Hospital, the family revealed that the hospital is yet to issue them with an official report, although they are allowed to see him.
From their observations, Kariuki's health remains stagnant, as he is still in the same condition in which he was admitted.
“We have not been told anything about his status. But we have visited him, and we can see that he is not responding; he is just there. The situation he was in is still the situation he is in,” the family's lawyer told the press.

Jonah Kariuki, Boniface's father, also expressed his worry, saying that he is only awaiting the day when the hospital will return his son alive, well, and as lively as he once was.
“Right now, I am very sad, I feel very bad because my son is still critically ill. I'd like them to return my son well, and the way he was,” Kariuki said.
The update by the family comes amid concerns from Kenyans that the mask vendor is not progressing with treatment.
""I sincerely hope KNH is not concealing the real situation of Boniface Kariuki,"" activist Hanifa Adan, one of those who have raised the concerns, said.
Doctors from KNH revealed that Boniface was in a critical condition in the Intensive Care Unit after being shot in the head at close range.
He underwent two emergency surgeries, including a delicate neurosurgical procedure to remove a bullet lodged in his skull. According to KNH CEO Dr William Sigilai, Kariuki is on mechanical ventilation and under round-the-clock observation by a multidisciplinary team.
Meanwhile, the family’s lawyer revealed that no government official has contacted them following the incident. They also tried to report the case at the Central Police Station but have so far been unable to do so.
""The family is yet to file a complaint with the police; they went to the Central Police Station to see those officials, but nothing went through. The government has also not contacted them, nor offered any type of assistance,"" the lawyer detailed.
Currently, the family has revealed that the hospital bill stands at Ksh 1 million, an amount they perceive will increase.

87 Companies Set to Shut Down,"Massive job losses are on the horizon after 24 companies issued notices of dissolution, signalling their subsequent closure.
“Under Section 897(4) of the Companies Act, it is notified for the information of the general public that the following companies are dissolved and their names have been struck off the Register of Companies with effect from the date of publication of this notice,” the notice read.
Further, 63 companies issued notices of intended dissolution, with the firms set to close shop over the next three months.
“Under Section 897(3) of the Companies Act, the Registrar of Companies gives notice that the names of the companies specified hereunder shall be struck off from the Register of Companies at the expiry of three months from the date of publication of this notice, and invites any person to show cause why the companies should not be struck off from the Register of Companies,” the notice stated.

In light of the new notices, the latest could trigger job losses across the various areas in which the companies are specialised.
In Kenya, the Registrar of Companies can order the dissolution of a company, commonly referred to as a ""strike-off"", primarily when there is non-compliance with statutory filing requirements, or when the Registrar reasonably believes the company is no longer carrying on business or is not in operation.
Failure to file annual returns and financial statements is one of the most common reasons companies are dissolved.
Companies are legally required to file annual returns and financial statements with the Registrar each year. If a company repeatedly fails to submit these documents, the Registrar may assume it is no longer active and initiate the strike-off process.
Additionally, failure to respond to official communications can lead to a company’s dissolution. If the Registrar sends letters to a company’s registered office and receives no response, or if the letters are returned undelivered, it may indicate that the company is no longer operating from its registered address.
Furthermore, failure to have and maintain a registered office can provide sufficient grounds for a company to be dissolved. A registered office address is a legal requirement.
If the Registrar can establish that a company no longer has a registered office or is not operating at the listed address, the regulator can proceed with a strike-off.
Although less common as a direct cause for strike-off, continuous non-compliance with core corporate governance obligations, such as failing to appoint or maintain a company secretary (where legally required), or not having the minimum number of directors, can raise concerns with the Registrar. This may prompt further investigation, which could lead to dissolution if the company is found to be defunct.
If the Registrar has reasonable cause to believe that a company is not carrying on business or is not in operation, based on public records, lack of filings, absence of activity, or information from third parties, they can initiate the strike-off process. This may be inferred from the absence of required filings or responses.
Typically, the dissolution process begins with warning letters, which include a 14- or 28-day ultimatum, followed by a gazette notice announcing the intended dissolution, and finally the formal strike-off.
Once a company is struck off, it ceases to exist as a legal entity. Its assets may become bona vacantia (ownerless property) and revert to the state. Directors and shareholders may also face penalties or liabilities if the strike-off was due to their non-compliance.

How The Standard Crafted Headlines That Shook the Nation,"In an age where gadgets rule and news is devoured digitally, getting the public to notice a newspaper takes serious effort. Yet one Mombasa Road-based media house appears to be doing just that, and setting the standard while at it.
For years, The Standard touted itself as Kenya’s boldest newspaper. But that boldness didn’t quite pack a punch until recently, when it went bare-knuckle against the government.
Let’s face it: the current regime needed to be kept in check, and the opposition wasn’t doing much of a job, especially after the broad-based handshake.
Someone had to step up, be it an individual, a group, a generation, or even an institution. In business, identifying gaps and providing solutions is the ultimate hack, and the team of editors at The Standard probably saw this and came up with a plan.
A side-by-side demonstration of The Standard Newspaper's headlines touching on President William Ruto.
They tried it once, twice, thrice, and it worked. Screenshots of the headlines went viral on X. They were everything the media should be: loud, clear, and a true voice of the people.
The headlines communicated what many Kenyans were murmuring behind closed doors. Their message was amplified in every sense; bold, hard-hitting, and entirely unbothered. The paper called out the President and his peers, parading their faces for all to see.
Kenyans seemed to have been longing for this. They were tired of rampant corruption, endless inquiries, and shady deals that left the country drowning in debt.
So, how exactly did The Standard pull this off?
According to seasoned editors at the media house, journalism was slowly losing its salt, and someone needed to bring back the flavour. Of course, it would come at a cost, but they were willing to pay.
“For a long time, the media has been operating in a very predictable way, barely going beyond the surface. We saw a need to speak up and amplify what society has been saying in the streets and on social media,” said a seasoned editor at the company.
“Our country has been bleeding for some time, and it was time to hold people to account. Our decision to run bold headlines was very deliberate, and they genuinely speak for the public.
“As journalists, we have a duty to inform and educate. We’ve gone beyond that by becoming a voice for the voiceless. We’re not activists, just journalists who want change,” added another.

Lying President, You’re Unfit to Lead, Our Turn to Eat, Tower of Babel, Ruthless President, Big Man Syndrome, and Blood on Their Hands, just a few of the headlines that stirred the pot.
Weren’t they afraid of the implications?
Another experienced editor said no one was holding the government accountable, and at some point, it had become business as usual for the regime.
“With all the scandals, even the opposition was coming off as exhausted. That’s when The Standard decided to step up.
“Didn’t you see our newspapers hoisted like placards during Maandamano? And the online chatter? We’ve been trending for weeks… So yes, the headlines are working, and we’ve earned public trust,” she quipped.
President William Ruto has been on the receiving end of most of the headlines that have squarely put him in the spotlight.
When he began his tour of Central in April, the Head of State claimed that Kenya was exporting tea to Sudan, a statement swiftly disputed by the Sudanese government. A few days later, former Public Service CS Justin Muturi poked holes in Ruto’s leadership, accusing him of an insatiable thirst for deals.

Then came a string of conflicting statements by senior security officials, hinting at divisions within the National Security Council, a case of disjointed communication, to say the least.
This was further compounded by Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen’s remarks on abducted Kenyans reunited with their families, comments that appeared to contradict his boss’s line.
These bold headlines didn’t go unnoticed. In April, the media house claimed the government was hell-bent on revoking its broadcasting licence.
Communications Authority of Kenya
The company revealed it received a notice from the Communications Authority (CA) announcing the revocation of its licence for allegedly failing to pay a Ksh43 million fee.
The media house stated that the Ksh43 million was a regulatory fee, agreed upon with the government in December last year after consultations.
In the agreement, Standard Group pledged to make an initial payment of Ksh10 million, which it honoured on December 27, and to pay a further Ksh24 million once the Rights Issue was finalised.
State House
On Saturday, May 31, Standard Group journalists were denied access to State House to cover a visit by Slovenian President Nataša Pirc Musar.
Speaking to Kenyans.co.ke, the journalists said that scribes from other media houses were granted entry, but there were specific instructions to block Standard reporters from going in.
Signal Hitch
On May 23, the media house announced a temporary downtime affecting its TV and radio stations, which resulted in service disruption.
In a brief statement on Friday morning, the group disclosed that most of its radio and TV platforms were temporarily off air due to a technical hitch.
ODM
The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) also hit out at Standard Group for allegedly running a smear campaign against party leader Raila Odinga and his family.
In a statement on Monday, May 5, the party’s Executive Director, Oduor Ong’wen, said the campaign negated, demeaned, and tarnished Odinga’s reputation.
This followed a story in The Standard headlined Our Turn to Eat, which pointed to some of Odinga’s relatives landing high-level state jobs following the March handshake with Ruto.
Oduor claimed the article was inappropriate, especially considering the “great personal risk” Odinga had taken for the nation.
Leaders
In April, Kericho Senator Aaron Cheruiyot slammed the Kenyan media over its coverage of the Kenya Kwanza administration, particularly President Ruto.
Speaking at the burial of former MP John Koech, the Senate Majority Leader criticised what he called “ridicule” and a lack of respect for the Office of the President.
Despite the backlash, the media house has remained resolute in its mission: calling out government ills and keeping the powerful in check.

Teachers Announce Date for Nationwide Strike,"The Kenya Union of Post-Primary Education Teachers (KUPPET) has given the Teachers' Service Commission (TSC) seven days to commence talks on a new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA); failure to which they will strike beginning June 28.
Led by its chairperson, Omboko Milemba, the union expressed concerns over the delays in talks for a new CBA, since the current one expires on June 30 this year.
Addressing journalists on Saturday, June 21, Milemba revealed that they had already notified Labour Cabinet Secretary Alfred Mutua about their concerns, as TSC had remained quiet on the matter.
During the presser, the KUPPET boss urged the CS to initiate the talks immediately, failure to which the union would be forced to call for a nationwide strike.

""TSC should invite us for talks, the other person who should also be involved is the Labour Cabinet Secretary, who should make sure that TSC convenes the talks immediately,"" Milemba stated.
""Other people who should also contribute to these talks are the Members of Parliament, in particular the National Assembly's Education Committee,"" he added.
KUPPET's Secretary General, Akello Misori, noted that the new CBA was of great significance, as it was meant to address teachers' welfare and motivate them.
""We have given the government seven days to address the issue of CBA because we do not want our members to be overexposed in an event there is no CBA beyond June 30,"" Akello Misori stated.
In the new CBA, KUPPET has proposed an increase in the teachers' basic pay by 50 per cent for teachers in higher job grades and a 100 per cent increase for teachers in lower job groups.
The union is also calling for the modernisation of teachers' house allowance by increasing it by 20 per cent for all teachers. Similarly, KUPPET is also demanding an increase in the hardship allowance for some teachers.
In the CBA, KUPPET is proposing an increase in the hardship allowance by 200 per cent for those in higher job grades and 250 per cent for those in lower job grades.
 Further, the union is demanding the introduction of an overtime allowance for teachers across the board. Nonetheless, KUPPET opposed the government's decision to remove the examination fee.

"KeNHA Cracks Down on County's Ksh20,000 Illegal Fines Outside Governor’s Office","The Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) has cracked down on the Busia County Government after it erected an illegal sign forcing motorists to pay fake fines of Ksh20,000.
In a notice dated June 13, KeNHA confirmed that the sign was put up without approval from the National Roads Authority.
“We visited the site and observed that the sign was installed on the frontage of the Governor’s premises, presumably to restrict its usage by vehicles or traders.
“We note that no approval has been issued to the County Government of Busia for the installation of the sign,” the notice reads.

The sign installed by the county reads: “No parking of vehicles is allowed around this zone. Offenders will be arrested and charged. Ordered by the County Government of Busia.”
KeNHA, however, ordered the Busia County Government to remove the sign with immediate effect.
The authority also warned the county to follow the proper legal process if it wishes to make any changes in future.
“As such, a directive has been issued to the county to immediately remove the sign and follow the due process to acquire its approval,” KeNHA noted.
Additionally, Busia Senator Okiya Omtatah confirmed that the county government had extorted motorists using unauthorised signs to impose Ksh20,000 fines.
""Despite their illegality, they are reportedly being used to impose fines of up to Ksh20,000, often without legal justification or due process,"" Omtatah stated.
Omtatah warned that public roads cannot be taken over by any government for personal gain.
“Public roads cannot be privatised or turned into toll points by rogue actors. We are guarding Kenya’s role as East Africa’s trade gateway and protecting the rights of motorists, traders, and citizens,” Omtatah said.

MP Heckled in Front of Ruto After Claiming Feed Prices Have Dropped,"Nominated MP Dorothy Muthoni faced a hostile reception during the 10th Annual Dairy Farmers Field Day in Meru County after claiming that President William Ruto’s administration had successfully lowered the cost of animal feeds.
The event, which drew thousands of livestock farmers from around the region and high-profile leaders, including President Ruto, had been organised to showcase innovation in the dairy industry in the region.
The crowd, relatively calm and collected, was charged when the MP took to the stage and started praising President Ruto, showcasing some of the projects he had done.
The farmers followed her speech until she reached the point where she alleged that the President had lowered the prices of animal feeds. In a quick rejoinder, the farmers rejected the claim and heckled the MP, forcing her to stop.

""We would like to thank you because you have been a big help to the Meru dairy farmers, you have reduced the price of animal feeds, and we are grateful...,"" the MP alleged.
However, before she could finish the statement, the charged crowd interrupted and heckled her, emphasising that the prices had not gone down.
“Hapana, hapana, hajafanya hivyo. Wapi hizo bei zimepungua? Tunateseka bado. (No, he has not done that. Where have the prices gone down? We are still suffering,” the farmers said.
The lawmaker was forced to acknowledge the concerns. She quickly changed her tune and promised the farmers that although this had not been done, the regional leadership would follow up to ensure the prices of animal feeds were reduced.
“If the prices have not been reduced, that is fine, but the president is here and we will look into the matter to ensure it is resolved,” Muthoni assured.
The bold response from the farmers expressed their growing frustration over the high cost of production, which they maintained had remained unsustainable.
While addressing the farmers at the event, President Ruto reaffirmed his commitment to the agriculture sector, assuring farmers that lowering the cost of milk production remains a top priority in his administration.
Also present at the event were Deputy President Kithure Kindiki, Cabinet Secretary for Public Service Geoffrey Ruku, Water and Irrigation Cabinet Secretary Eric Muga, and other leaders.

2025 Finance Bill: Why it Matters to Kenyans & How They Can Benefit,"On June 19, 2025, Parliament passed the Finance Bill 2025 after intense debate and massive public interest. But what does this mean for you, the ordinary mwananchi trying to make ends meet, build a life, raise a family, and grow a hustle?
The Bill touches on everyday life: what you earn, what you spend, how you save, and how the government uses your taxes.
In the Bill, which has received its fair share of criticism, there are several key areas the government, through the Ministry of Treasury, argued would benefit Kenyans.
Firstly, the Bill proposes an amendment to the First Schedule of the Income Tax Act to explicitly exempt gratuity and other allowances paid under public pension schemes from taxation. It further seeks to repeal subsections (4) to (9A) of Section 8 of the Income Tax Act, which currently govern the tax treatment of pensions and retirement benefits under both private schemes and the National Social Security Fund (NSSF).

Since the Bill was passed, this now means that if you are retiring, your full payout is yours. No more tax deductions on your gratuity.
Additionally, the Bill had proposed an increased tax-free ceiling for per diems from the current Ksh2,000 to Ksh10,000. This means that employees receiving a daily allowance for official travel will have a larger portion of that allowance exempt from income tax. This change is to be effective from July 1, 2025.
If you trade in cryptocurrency, NFTs, or earn online, your tax is now halved. Specifically, the Bill proposes a reduction in the Digital Asset Tax rate from the current three per cent to 1.5 per cent. This tax is levied on the transfer or exchange value of digital assets.
According to the government, this move would be key in encouraging youth and digital hustlers to thrive in an online economy and ensure compliance by making the tax burden less prohibitive.
In this year’s Finance Bill, provisions were made that directly affected foreign companies like Netflix and Google. The primary tax touching on these digital service providers is the Significant Economic Presence (SEP) Tax, which is intended to replace the previous Digital Service Tax (DST).
The 2025 Finance Bill proposed to expand the scope of the SEP tax to include income derived or accrued from Kenya through a business carried out via the internet or an electronic network, including through a digital marketplace. 
This directly targets non-resident entities that generate revenue from Kenyan consumers without necessarily having a physical presence in the country. This means platforms offering streaming services (like Netflix), digital advertising (like Google Ads), online marketplaces, and other digital content services would be subject to this tax.
By doing so, local digital companies could compete fairly, and Kenya earns revenue from foreign profits.
The 2025 Kenyan Finance Bill included a provision where the Excise Duty Act would adopt the East African Community (EAC) Customs Union Protocol for goods classification. The move is designed to standardise classification rules for goods, reduce customs disputes, improve regional trade consistency, and support import/export accuracy.
Essentially, the provision is aimed at aligning Kenya's excise duty classifications with those of the broader EAC bloc, enabling smoother trade within the region.
The Bill also promised tax relief whereby one would no longer need to buy a house to get mortgage tax relief — even if you build through a SACCO or a personal loan, you qualify automatically.
For companies, the Bill introduced a provision aimed at providing clear tax terms, particularly for large companies involved in international transactions. This was done through the introduction of an Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) framework.
APAs are agreements between the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) and a taxpayer (typically a large multinational company) that determine, in advance, the pricing methods to be applied to specific related-party transactions for a set period.
Through this, big firms can agree on tax arrangements with KRA for up to five years, with the framework designed to attract stable investment and protect jobs.
Other provisions, such as no introduction of new PAYE tax bands, restrictions on the taxman’s ability to access one’s data, zero-rated tax reforms on essential commodities, and corporate tax breaks for key sectors, were included in the new Finance Bill.
In recent times, the Finance Bill has become a touchy subject among the Kenyan population, especially after demonstrations were witnessed following the passing of the 2024 Finance Bill.

Several Businesses at Risk of Closure After Governor Orders Crackdown,"Several businesses in Murang'a County are at risk of closure following a directive by Governor Irungu Kang'ata, who ordered a crackdown on non-compliant traders.
The governor on Saturday, June 21, ordered a crackdown targeting businesses with fake or expired single business permits and those with unpaid county fees.
Kang'ata noted that the county-wide inspection would commence on June 23 and would also target business premises with counterfeit liquor licenses.
In the notice, the governor said the crackdown was to promote compliance, uphold fair business practices, and protect legitimate businesses and consumers.
Murang'a Governor Irungu Kang'ata addressed residents at a past event in the region. IRUNGU KANG'ATA
However, the governor assured residents that the crackdown would only target non-compliant businesses, reiterating that legitimate businesses would not be affected.
""The Murang’a County Government will commence a county-wide inspection starting 23rd June 2025, focusing on: counterfeit liquor licences, fake or expired Single Business Permits, and unpaid county fees and dues,"" Kang’ata announced.
""Legitimate businesses will not be affected. County officers will conduct the exercise with professionalism, respect, and integrity,"" the governor emphasised.
To avoid closure, business owners were advised to immediately verify their licences and permits before June 23 and ensure all county fees are fully paid.
Kang’ata’s directive comes barely six days after the Kisumu County Government launched inspections against illegal businesses to ensure compliance with regulations and curb revenue leakages.
Speaking during the commencement of the operation on June 13, Kisumu City Manager Abala Wanga said the county government would not tolerate continued disregard of licensing laws.
The crackdown also targeted illegal billboards and other signage placed within the city without the county government's approval. He said the crackdown was informed by a recent investigation that unravelled widespread non-compliance by city traders.
""We will go shop by shop. If you haven’t applied or paid for your business license, do so now. Anyone found with irregular or fake documents will pay double the required fees,” Abala Wanga noted.

Raila Slapped With Demands Hours After His Comments on Adani Deal,"The Motorists Association of Kenya has called on former Prime Minister Raila Odinga to retract his support for the defunct Adani deal and instead respect the will of the Kenyan people.
The Association, on Saturday, June 21, accused Odinga of betraying public trust by endorsing controversial Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) such as the Adani deal.
According to the motorists, the deal was exploitative and was rightly rejected by Kenyans through sustained outcry and civic engagement. Supporting it, they argued, undermined national sovereignty.
In their statement, the motorists labelled the now-cancelled PPP agreement with the Indian conglomerate as part of the cleverly disguised schemes to surrender vital national assets to foreign multinational interests under the guise of progress.

""Every intelligent and patriotic Kenyan understands the danger posed by many of the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) deals currently being pursued and sealed,"" read part of a statement by the Association.
""In truth, long-term concessions, often spanning 30 years or more, are typically imposed on countries that have defaulted on loan repayments. Kenya is not in default,"" it added.
While criticising the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party leader, the motorists noted that it was disappointing to witness Raila, a leader who once inspired hope for justice and equity, sympathising with imperialistic concessions.
""We therefore call upon Raila Odinga to reconsider his stance and to side with the people who once marched alongside him in pursuit of freedom, equity, and dignity,"" the motorists demanded.
They added, ""His legacy need not be tarnished by association with unjust deals that sell our national assets to the highest bidder. The struggle for economic liberation continues.""
The Motorists Association's statement came a day after the former Prime Minister expressed regret over the cancellation of the Adani deal that was meant for the expansion of the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA).
Odinga, who spoke on the second day of the executive retreat, noted that the country was at a critical stage where the leadership must rise above crowd-pleasing rhetoric and make tough decisions in the best interest of the nation.
“I was very disappointed when we were not able to move on with the (Adani) airport contract. When Adani was brought in, there was all that politicking that resulted in its cancellation,” he asserted.
“If development around the airport is not done, Nairobi could end up becoming dormant,” he added.

EU Raises Concerns Over Kenya’s Readiness for 2027 Elections,"The European Union has flagged the delayed reforms at the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) as a major cause for concern ahead of the 2027 General Election.
In the final report of the European Union Election Follow-up Mission (EU EFM) to Kenya, the EU highlighted the delayed reforms and concerns over the independence of a future Commission free from political interference.
“Most EU EFM interlocutors raised concerns about the ability of a future commission to operate as an independent body objectively and transparently, emphasising that public perception of the IEBC is largely negative,” the EU noted in its report.
According to the EU, the electoral management body is viewed as weak and vulnerable to interference from the political establishment.

In terms of IEBC reforms, the EU noted that despite the recent appointment of IEBC chair Erastus Ethekon and his team of Commissioners by President William Ruto, prior delays in their appointment were likely to prove costly.
The EU listed pending by-elections, five for the National Assembly and four at the county level, overdue constituency delimitation, and postponed voter registration as key areas of concern regarding preparations for the 2027 elections.
Further, the EU raised the alarm over the lack of an approved strategic plan that outlines, in detail and with specific deadlines, the actions and activities of the IEBC ahead of and beyond the next electoral cycle.
The issue of funding was also highlighted. The EU stated that underfunding and delays in allocating funds for the 2027 polls would significantly hamper the electoral process.
The IEBC has requested a budget of Ksh 61 billion (approximately EUR 435 million) for the 2027 General Election, but the government has allocated only Ksh 55 billion (approximately EUR 390 million), with a request that the amount be spread over five years.
“To address this funding gap, the IEBC must seek support from development partners, especially for voter education campaigns and training of electoral staff,” the EU noted.
The latest comes after a recent TIFA report released in May disclosed that 50 per cent of Kenyans had no confidence at all in the integrity of the 2027 elections.
According to the report, which was released on Wednesday, May 5, Kenyans believed that the upcoming general polls would mainly be compromised by factors such as political interference, graft, and failures of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).
TIFA has further noted that 18 per cent of other Kenyans believe that other factors, such as insecurity, refusal of the president and other candidates to accept defeat, technological failures, a history of rigging, and insufficient time to prepare for the elections, will sabotage the integrity of the upcoming elections.

"How Father of Shot Mask Vendor Was Conned Ksh200,000","Jonah Kariuki, father of Boniface Kariuki, the mask vendor who was shot by police during protests, has been scammed out of Ksh 200,000 by individuals posing as officials from the Social Health Authority (SHA).
According to a statement by the family’s spokesperson, Emily Wanjiru, the fraudsters contacted Kariuki, claiming they would assist with settling the hospital bills.
The spokesperson explained that Kariuki received a call from someone purporting to work with SHA, who claimed they needed to register the family into the scheme and help pay the bill.
The fraudsters falsely told Kariuki that he needed to provide a certain amount of money to facilitate SHA registration. Naively, he shared his personal details, including his M-Pesa PIN, which they then used to wipe the entire amount from his account.

Speaking to Kenyans.co.ke, Kariuki confirmed that indeed the money was stolen by the fraudsters; however, he detailed that the scammers had initially asked for Ksh20,000.
""Yes, it is true, they scammed me out of Ksh 200,000, but it was a mistake. They had asked for Ksh 20,500, but during the transaction process, I mistakenly keyed in Ksh 200,500,"" Kariuki explained to this reporter.
According to Kariuki, attempts to recover the money have remained futile, as the fraudsters switched off their phone. He also revealed that the M-Pesa message detailing the transaction was deleted.
He disclosed that he is currently engaging the relevant authorities to recover the lost funds.
It is important for Kenyans to be aware of such fraudsters and to note that SHA registration is entirely free. There are three main ways to register: USSD registration (no internet needed), online registration, and employer registration (for businesses).
Kariuki also revealed that the family will be holding a press conference outside Kenyatta National Hospital to provide updates on Boniface’s condition.
The 22-year-old has undergone two surgeries to remove bullet fragments from his head.
Boniface, who was caught in the chaos of the June 17 demonstrations, arrived at KNH’s Accident and Emergency Department at 3:16 PM in a critical state.

Babu Owino Goes After Sakaja Following Goons' Confessions,"Embakasi East Member of Parliament Babu Owino has criticised Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja after some goons confessed to being paid by an influential individual.
Several goons, during an interview conducted by Citizen TV, confessed that they were paid as little as Ksh 50 to cause destruction during the demonstration, which took place on June 17.
Some added that they were later deceived and were not paid any amount at all by the said individual.
In his statement on Saturday, June 21, Owino continued to blame Sakaja for allegedly hiring goons and betraying the residents of Nairobi.

He claimed that hawkers and youths who were part of the protest were being harassed and beaten by groups working under the county's orders.
“Governor Sakaja, Nairobi did not elect you to unleash goons on its people. You promised leadership. You spoke of change. But what we’re seeing is betrayal.”
“Vendors are being harassed. Youths are being beaten. Voices of dissent are being silenced not with facts, but with fists. Is this the ‘new Nairobi’ you promised?” Owino said.
He accused Sakaja’s administration of ruling through fear and intimidation instead of offering responsible leadership.
""You were elected to fix broken systems, not to break the people. You were given power to serve, not to suppress. Every time your administration sends goons to intimidate the people, you remind us: you are not leading. You are ruling through fear,"" he added.
His statement came after rumours spread alleging that Sakaja had sponsored the goons to disrupt the protest that took place on June 17.
Sakaja, however, responded to the allegations, stating that he is innocent and did not take part in such activities.
“Such blatant lies. On Sunday, I was in Lugari for church and came back to Nairobi on Monday afternoon via Kitale. Ticket below. I have not seen Gaucho since he attended the Mukuru Housing launch, or Swaleh, in many months,” Sakaja clarified.

How Chinese National Lost Ksh13M to Kenyan Woman,"The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) on Friday, June 20, revealed the arrest of a Kenyan woman who had allegedly conned a Chinese national out of Ksh 13 million (USD 101,100).
“A 38-year-old woman has been apprehended by Kamukunji detectives for her role in a bold scam that deceived a Chinese national out of USD 101,000 (Ksh 13M),” the DCI stated.
In a statement, the detectives detailed how the woman posed as the director of a local scrap trading company and claimed she was in a position to supply the foreigner with aluminium alloys.
As part of her elaborate scheme, she provided the victim with a forged bill of lading and a counterfeit Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) certificate of conformity.

These documents falsely asserted that a consignment of 23,890 kilograms of aluminium alloys had been securely packed in a 40-foot container, ready for shipment from the Port of Mombasa to Ningbo, China.
With the certificate and the accompanying documents that appeared to confirm her credibility, the Chinese national went on to transfer the millions into her account. However, this is when the woman disappeared.
“After the unsuspecting complainant transferred a hefty USD 101,100 into Wabwire's bank account, she promptly switched off her phone and vanished without a trace,” the DCI stated.
Despite numerous attempts to contact the woman, the Chinese national’s efforts proved futile. Consequently, they sought assistance from the police, who launched a manhunt for the suspect.
Following investigations and forensic leads, detectives successfully tracked her to a hideout in Tassia, Nairobi, where she was arrested.
The sleuths disclosed that the suspect is now in custody and undergoing processing as she awaits arraignment.
Cases of Kenyans conning foreign nationals are common, with most cases linked to hefty sums of money at play. 
Early this year, DCI announced the arrest of  14 Kenyans allegedly involved in a Ksh174 million gold scam.
The 14 were arrested along Chalbi Drive within the Lavington area of Nairobi after weeks of surveillance and a relentless hunt for the city's gold scamming ring.
Preliminary investigations conducted by the detectives had revealed that the suspects obtained the money after allegedly scamming a businessman from the United States.

CBD Goons Reveal How They Were Mobilised,"Goons who infiltrated protests in Nairobi’s Central Business District (CBD) have come forward, confessing to being hired by influential individuals to disrupt the peaceful marches.
While speaking to Citizen TV, several of the goons admitted to being paid as little as Ksh50 to cause disruption, with some even lamenting that they were short-changed and ended up receiving no payment at all.
The goons were brought in to create havoc during the protests held on Tuesday, June 17, in honour of Albert Ojwang. Wielding sticks, they unleashed terror on protesters and looted shops. It was rumoured that the group had been paid by politicians.
Further, the goons were said to have had the backing of the police, with footage surfacing online showing law enforcement officers appearing indifferent to the breakdown of law and order caused by the group.

While revealing details of their assignment, the goons noted that their ‘bosses’ had promised to pay them Ksh2,000, but only after the job was done.
Most of them came from informal settlements around Nairobi, such as Kibera and Korogocho. In terms of numbers, one of them disclosed that his group comprised approximately 83 individuals.
After being mobilised, the goons were briefed at specific points across the city, such as the junction along Dennis Pritt Road and Greenpark, from where they would ride into the city on boda bodas.
However, some of them ended up on the receiving end of vigilante groups who expressed their displeasure at the disruption of their commercial activities in the name of wreaking havoc.
Several goons sustained injuries, with some of those interviewed displaying broken limbs and head trauma.
Notably, one of their alleged bosses, the infamous Swaleh, is rumoured to have gone into hiding upcountry, with footage of him on his knees apologising surfacing online.
Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja, who has faced immense backlash over rumours of sponsoring the goons, came out strongly to deny the claims, even going so far as to provide receipts to prove his innocence.
He denied holding secret meetings with Gaucho and Swaleh, the individuals rumoured to be the link between the goons and politicians, to plan how the protests would be disrupted.
Reports had alleged that, before the protests, the governor met with several leaders, including Gaucho, a sitting Nairobi MP, an MCA, and the infamous Swaleh, and issued them with funds to sponsor the goons.
However, Sakaja distanced himself from the allegations, clarifying that he was not in the city on the said day. He provided evidence to show that he had travelled to Lugari and had not convened the alleged meeting.

"Another Cop Caught on Camera Shooting at Protesters, Escapes on Motorcycle","A distressing video has emerged showing a police officer shooting at protesters during Friday’s demonstrations in the Mwiki area of Kasarani.
In the video seen by Kenyans.co.ke, the officer is seen aiming and shooting directly at the protesters before fleeing the scene on a bodaboda.
The protests had erupted after an 18-year-old woman was found murdered by unknown assailants in the area. Kasarani residents took to the streets to protest the killing and demand justice.
The protesters had lit a bonfire along the Sunton–Kasarani road, disrupting businesses for the better part of Friday.

Police had been deployed in the area to disperse the protesters and return business to normalcy when the unfortunate shooting happened.
This incident comes against the backdrop of a troubling pattern of police violence during public demonstrations.
The video sparked outrage among Kenyans on social media, who have raised the alarm over the increasing number of youths being shot by police during protests.
With the upcoming June 25 protests, to honour Gen Zs who lost their lives during the anti-Finance Bill 2024 demonstrations, many Kenyans have been left questioning whether such shootings will continue.
Currently, two police officers have been arrested following a similar incident witnessed in Nairobi CBD.
Officers Klinzy Barasa and Duncan Kiprono were arrested over the shooting of Boniface Mwangi Kariuki, a mask vendor in the CBD, on Tuesday, June 17, during protests.
The court ordered that the two officers be detained for 15 days to allow the Independent Policing and Oversight Authority (IPOA) to investigate the incident.
The growing number of such cases has intensified calls for reforms in the security sector. ACK bishops drawn from Nyanza have challenged President William Ruto to disband security units in the country, including the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, to allow for a clean start.

Ruto Reveals What is Wrong With His Administration & How He Plans to Fix It,"Financial risks arising from budget shortfalls and funding gaps for programmes supported by development partners, weak monitoring and evaluation systems, and indiscipline in project and programme execution have been listed as some of the teething issues affecting service delivery in President William Ruto’s administration.
In a communiqué released by Ruto’s office, the President listed ten ‘systemic risks’, including those mentioned above, that were said to be hampering the effective execution of his manifesto.
Even so, the Ruto-led administration introduced 20 measures aimed at strengthening government service delivery to enhance performance and deepen public confidence in its ability to meet the people’s needs and expectations.
Weak vertical and horizontal collaborative governance, a silo approach in the implementation of government initiatives, and litigation, legal, and bureaucratic bottlenecks were also listed as challenges facing Ruto’s administration.

In addition, geopolitical realignments, conflicts, tensions, climate shocks, technological disruptions, cybersecurity threats, misinformation, disinformation, and the battle of narratives, along with the weaponisation of legitimate concerns into violent agitations, also emerged as factors constraining service delivery.
To address this, Ruto listed several key interventions, including deepening inter-governmental collaboration, streamlining vertical and horizontal collaborative governance, and training more Kenyan youth in multiple foreign languages to improve their competitiveness for global employment opportunities.
He further proposed reimagining the strategic vision for stimulating economic growth and job creation, defining pathways through a whole-of-government approach, expanding capacities in special economic zones, and exploring new markets for Kenyan products as part of the resolution strategy.
Deepening stakeholder engagement at different levels, securing bilateral partnerships aligned with the transformation agenda, and creating mechanisms to protect the interests of Kenyans in conflict regions were also identified as essential to improving the situation.
In the crucial agricultural sector, significant enhancements were planned. These include improving the quality of data across all agricultural sub-sectors to support evidence-based policies and interventions.
The ultimate goal is to consolidate and sustain gains in food production, boost farmers’ incomes, and create more jobs across the agricultural value chain. A particularly strong action point was accelerating the off-take of farmers’ produce, directly putting more money into their pockets.
Education was also prioritised, with specific plans to address the teacher-learner ratio. The government intends to accelerate teacher recruitment, a crucial step for the effective implementation of the Competency-Based Education and Training (CBET) curriculum.
Beyond staffing, a concerted effort is underway to enhance educational infrastructure. This includes building modern laboratories and other essential facilities to upgrade schools nationwide, ensuring the delivery of high-quality education.
Additionally, the new funding model for universities will undergo fine-tuning to streamline and enrich the means-testing instrument, aiming to ensure every student is placed in the correct financial band and to avoid any disenfranchisement.
In healthcare, the administration reiterated its commitment to ensuring universal access. A key resolution involves registering every Kenyan and their dependents under the Social Health Insurance scheme.
This initiative will be complemented by the strategic rollout of modern medical equipment, using various financing frameworks involving both counties and suppliers. Furthermore, the retreat stressed the importance of completing reforms at the Kenya Medical Supplies Agency (KEMSA) in accordance with the agreed framework between the national and county governments.
The government also aims to scale up the digitisation of all services, mandating that every Ministry, Department, and Agency (MDA) be onboarded onto the e-Citizen platform. This is expected to significantly improve efficiency, reduce corruption, and further boost government revenue.
Beyond these core sectors, the government is focusing on broader economic and social measures to enhance livelihoods and global competitiveness. These include facilitating financial inclusion for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) through the Hustler Fund framework. The Affordable Housing Programme will continue to be scaled up, with an emphasis on advancing the construction sector value chain.
Finally, efforts to accelerate labour mobility coordination will involve forging new Bilateral Labour Agreements and renegotiating existing ones to engage a more professional Kenyan workforce globally.

Nairobi County Issues Advisory to Motorists,"The leadership of Nairobi County has deployed officers to designated areas across the city to unblock the drainage system as the short rainy season officially begins.
Speaking on Friday, Nairobi County Chief Officer of Environment Geoffrey Mosiria revealed that the county is working to find a permanent solution to the city's flooding challenge every time it rains.
While the county is working on the solution, Mosiria has advised motorists in flood-prone areas of the city, including Westlands, Kilimani, and Parklands, to exercise extra caution while driving during this rainy season.
“The rains have begun, and we urge all motorists within Nairobi County to exercise extra caution. According to our environmental experts, we expect heavy rainfall over the next three days,” Mosiria advised.

Mosiria blamed the flooding challenge on Kenyans and hawkers who do not practise proper waste management, littering the city indiscriminately and leading to blocked drainage systems.
“We are on the ground, and our teams have been activated to address the mess created over many years. We have deployed our officers to unblock the drainage systems,”  the officer continued.
The environment officer challenged city dwellers and hawkers to adopt proper waste management practices to help combat future flooding in the city.
“I wish that, as a patriotic Kenyan, you would use this media platform to educate the people of Nairobi on the importance of keeping the environment clean and practising proper solid waste management at the source,” Mosiria continued.
The county has also issued a stern warning to city developers encroaching on drainage channels and constructing on riparian zones, warning that such actions will not be tolerated.
The county reiterated its original plan to uproot all illegal structures along rivers in a move to permanently solve flooding in the city.
“These areas are vital for water flow and environmental balance; they are not meant for settlement or development,” Mosiria continued.
The advisory by the county leadership follows a detailed report by the Kenya Meteorological Department, which listed Nairobi as one of the regions expected to receive heavy rainfall over the next five days.

Kenya Met Lists Nairobi Amongst Regions to Receive Rainfall Over the Weekend,"The Kenya Meteorological Department has listed Nairobi among seven regions across the country that are set to receive rainfall over the weekend.
In its latest five-day weather advisory released on Friday, June 20, the weatherman revealed the capital would experience showers and cloudy conditions across the morning, afternoon, and night. Maximum temperatures during the day were forecasted to be 27°C while nighttime temperatures were predicted to be 9°C.  
Nairobi was listed as one of the areas in the broader Highlands East of the Rift Valley region expected to experience such temperatures. Other areas included Nyandarua, Laikipia, Nyeri, Kirinyaga, Murang’a, Kiambu, Meru, Embu, and Tharaka.
On the other hand, Kenya Met predicted that the Coast region, encompassing Mombasa, Kilifi, Lamu, and Kwale Counties, as well as coastal parts of Tana River County, would experience mostly sunny conditions during the day, with light showers in a few areas over the next five days.

Boda Boda Riders Issue Notice Ahead of June 25 Protests,"The Boda Boda Safety Association of Kenya has distanced itself from the upcoming protest on June 25, urging citizens who will take part to conduct a peaceful demonstration.
In a statement issued on Friday, June 20, the association stated that they are not tools for any political games.
The association further clarified that boda boda riders are not part of any destruction caused during the protest.
""We have seen the threats of chaos. We've heard the calls for protests and riots on 25th June 2025. But we say this clearly: We are not part of that destruction. We are not tools for political games. We are hustlers, and we ride for peace, dignity, and survival,"" the statement reads.

The riders said that their motorbikes are often damaged and their members are frequently caught up in clashes when protests turn violent, calling on the government to protect them.
""We urge the Government: protect our roads, protect our bikes, protect our lives. We are not looking for favours, we're asking for fairness,"" the association said.
They, however, asked for a peaceful demonstration, stating that any disruption caused by the protests would affect their earnings.
They added that they support the right to protest, but only if it is peaceful and lawful, with no stones, no fire, no looting. 
""We respect the Constitution. We believe in Article 37 - the right to assemble and protest. But only if it is peaceable and unarmed. No stone, no fire, no looting. Because once violence starts, the Constitution walks away. And so do we,"" part of the statement reads.
Additionally, the association issued a warning to anyone planning to disrupt any boda boda operations during the demonstration.
""And to those planning to disrupt our routes and risk our safety: you don't speak for us. You don't care about our pain. Don't hide your chaos behind our helmets.""
""Boda boda riders have built a name in this country. We help emergency cases, support families, and move the economy. We will not be reduced to pawns in someone else's war,"" the statement added.
The riders' notice came after two motorcycles were burnt and a rider was badly beaten by angry protesters, who accused them of disrupting the protest on June 17.

Charlene Ruto Blames Millennials for Tension Between Gen Z & Older Kenyans,"Charlene Ruto has blamed millennials for what she termed as ‘the endless and senseless conflict’ between Gen Zs and older Kenyans, particularly in matters of national interest.
Through a statement released on Friday, June 20, the daughter of President William Ruto criticised millennials for failing to serve as the proper go-between that the two generations could use to peacefully coexist.
While calling for a generational ceasefire, Charlene stated that millennials, by falling on either side of the two generations, had a critical role to play in ensuring long-term peace and stability.
“I would partially blame us, millennials, for the endless and senseless conflict between the senior citizens and young Gen Zs,” she stated.

“We, as the older brothers and sisters who understand both generations but have failed to mediate for peaceful coexistence, provide leadership and clarity in tough times, and offer our young people guidance on alternatives that don’t necessarily lead to violent riots that only end up deepening wounds, encouraging radicalisation and, in extreme cases, unfortunate loss of life,” Charlene elaborated.
While reiterating her call for national unity, Charlene chastised vices such as violence, revenge, rage-hunting, cancel culture, hooliganism, cyberbullying, and violent riots, which she noted would erode national culture, radicalise youth, and induce dangerous instability.
By incorporating civil and objective-driven alternatives, the President’s daughter opined that this would pave the way for a better relationship between all generations in the national circle.
To that effect, Charlene proposed inter-generational dialogues, policy recommendations, and actively lobbying for sensible reforms as a way forward.
Her comments come amidst the patterns observed between Gen Zs, who have recently taken the mantle of advocating for national reforms, albeit in a more direct and somewhat radical manner, and older generations who have always exercised caution and restraint.
This was at play during last year’s anti-Finance Bill protests where Gen Zs were on the forefront. At the height of the protests, the Gen Zs, backed by their ‘organic’ nature, rallied through the mantra of being ‘leaderless, tribeless and fearless.’ 
Meanwhile, the older generations were against taking to the streets, urging the youth to seek alternative measures such as dialogue to air out their grievances. 
The millennials, on the other hand, were caught in between, with some joining the protests either through taking to the streets or using digital means, while others steered clear of engaging in any form of resistance.
Born roughly between 1997 and 2012, Gen Zs are characterised by their digital fluency and global interconnectedness. Millennials, also known as Generation Y, were born between 1981 and 1996. They are the first generation to grow up with widespread access to the internet.
Older generations include Generation X, born between 1965 and 1980, and the Baby Boomers, born between 1946 and 1964.

Highly Anticipated Nairobi Event Cancelled as June 25 Protests Loom,"The Blankets and Wine event slated for Sunday, June 29, has been cancelled over security concerns ahead of the June 25 protests.
In a statement released on Friday, June 20, organisers revealed that the decision to call off the highly anticipated event, which was to feature international artistes, was informed by consultations between security teams and partners.
They cited the planned protests scheduled for Wednesday, June 25, as key to their decision, noting that any unrest witnessed on the day could spill over to the event.
“In light of the ongoing unrest within our country, and specifically the anticipated nationwide demonstrations on June 25th, we regret to inform you that we have made the difficult, yet necessary decision to cancel the upcoming June edition of Blankets & Wine that is slated for 29th June, 2025,” the statement read.

“This decision has been made after deep consultations with our security teams and partners, who have flagged the situation as volatile and high risk in regard to potential damage to property and physical harm to set-up teams,” it added.
The organisers noted that despite the significant investment made in putting together the event, as seen in the size and scale of their production, the safety of the Blankets community was far more important.
They further expressed their support by standing in solidarity with other Kenyans in light of the heightened political pressures.
Additionally, people who had bought tickets for the event were set to receive a full refund for all tickets purchased. For season ticket holders, a proportional refund for the June portion of the ticket would be issued.
Refunds will be processed within 14 working days via the original payment method.
The planned June 25 protests are set to be held in honour of Gen Zs who were victims of the deadly 2024 anti-Finance Bill demonstrations. The protests are being championed by the families of the victims of last year’s protests and a section of influential activists.
A formal notice was issued at the Central Police Station last week by the families of the fallen Gen Zs seeking permission to hold what they termed as ‘a peaceful march in their honour.’
The peaceful procession was to head to the Office of the President and Parliament and would involve the laying of flowers to mark the deaths of the youths. 
Nairobi Police Regional Commander George Sedah on Thursday, June 19, confirmed receipt of the notice, pledging to protect Kenyans who would seek to participate in the protests.
However, it remains to be seen whether the picketing will remain peaceful, with fears running high over the possibility of goons infiltrating the planned march.

Govt Asked to Crack Down on NGOs Funding Protesters,"Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei has urged the government to crack down on Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) that are said to support activists and allegedly fund the protests witnessed in the country.
While speaking to members of the press on Friday, June 20, Cherargei claimed that the said NGOs were ‘unhappy with Kenya’s stability’ and called upon the government to use foreign intelligence networks to track alleged payments made.
He also called upon the body in charge of regulating NGOs in Kenya to take action and ensure that activists receiving backing from NGOs are registered.
“Most of our foreign friends are not happy that our country is stable. That is why they are pouring illicit money to fund some of these demonstrations,” the senator stated.

“I want to appeal to the government to use foreign intelligence networks to be on the lookout for the money that is being sent into the country to finance some of these illicit and illegal activists,” Cherargei stated.
His remarks come as the country gears up for major protests planned for Wednesday, June 25, in honour of Gen Zs who died in last year’s anti-Finance Bill demonstrations. The protests are being championed by the families of the victims of last year’s protests and a section of influential activists.
Last week, families of the fallen Gen Zs issued a formal notice to the Central Police Station seeking permission to hold a peaceful procession in their honour.
The planned peaceful marches were to the Office of the President and Parliament, in remembrance of the young people who died while protesting against the 2024 Finance Bill.
Nairobi Police Regional Commander George Sedah on Thursday, June 19, confirmed receipt of the notice, pledging to protect Kenyans who would seek to participate in the protests.
Aside from that assurance, Sedah added that police had put in place ‘enhanced plans’ ahead of protests, and warned against using violence or inciting police officers.
“We will provide enough and good security for all Kenyans to ensure that every person who is going to participate or be affected by the protests will be safe,” Sedah assured.
Cherargei’s sentiments on NGOs are not far-fetched, as American NGO Ford Foundation was accused by President William Ruto of financing last year’s protests. 
The President accused the international firm of funnelling funds to unidentified groups in Kenya to stage protests and destabilise the country. He had further alleged that the organisation harboured ill motives and was operating against Kenya's best interests and democracy.

"Sakaja Drops Receipts, Denies Meeting With Gaucho and Swaleh","Nairobi County Governor Johnson Sakaja has denied allegations that he held a secret meeting with Gaucho and Swaleh to plan how goons would disrupt Nairobi protests.
Reports had alleged that, before the protests, the governor met with several leaders, including Gaucho, a sitting Nairobi MP, an MCA, and the infamous Swaleh, and issued them with funds to sponsor the goons.
According to the allegations, the governor released Ksh2 million and gave it to Gaucho to mobilise goons to neutralise protestors using machetes and rungus, and to sponsor chaos.
In a quick rejoinder, Sakaja distanced himself from the allegations, clarifying that he was not in the city on the said day. While providing evidence, the governor revealed that he had travelled to Lugari and did not convene the alleged meeting.

“Such blatant lies. On Sunday, I was in Lugari for Church and came back to Nairobi on Monday afternoon through Kitale. Ticket below. I have not seen Gaucho since he attended the Mukuru Housing Launch or Swaleh in many months,” Sakaja clarified.
According to the tickets provided by the governor, he had travelled from Kitale to Nairobi on Monday, June 16, at 10 am, disregarding the allegations that he was in the city on Sunday and conducted the meeting as alleged.
Gaucho also responded to the allegations, claiming that he was not in Kenya and that the claims that he had met with the governor to arrange the disruptions were fabricated lies.
Nairobi CBD witnessed chaos on Tuesday, June 17, after youths took to the streets to demand justice for the death of Albert Ojwang, who died while in police custody.
What began as peaceful calls for justice quickly escalated into chaos, looting, and running battles between police and youths. Goons descended on the streets, destroying and looting businesses.
The governor reiterated his previous statements that the goons were not affiliated with his office and condemned the violence as criminal.
He urged the National Police Service to arrest those responsible and insisted the gangs were 'brought in from outside Nairobi'.
“We strongly condemn the destruction of public and private property witnessed last week, perpetrated by hired goons brought in from outside Nairobi,” he added.

Protests Erupt in Kasarani,"Residents of Kasarani Estate in Nairobi on Friday, June 20, staged demonstrations to protest the killing of a young girl who was found murdered by unknown assailants.
During the demonstrations, the angry locals lit a bonfire along the Sunton-Kasarani road, disrupting businesses for the better part of Friday morning and afternoon.
Videos and images shared widely on the internet showed a group of youths marching along the road, hoisting twigs and placards to demand justice for the deceased.
According to witnesses, the 19-year-old was found dead inside her mother's house, with residents claiming that she was reportedly assaulted by the perpetrators before her tragic murder.

Reports further indicated that the deceased's body was found lying on a sofa set, with blood oozing from the neck and mouth, depicting the extent of the murder.
Other witnesses claimed that the teenage girl had just completed her high school studies and was awaiting enrolment in a tertiary institution for further studies.
Footage of the protests showed thick black smoke emanating from the scene, with some locals recorded watching the events unfold from the comfort of their apartment balconies.
The protests paralysed transport along the Kasarani-Roysambu stretch. Motorists using the road were forced to divert and seek alternative routes even as the demonstrations escalated.  
Moments later, a contingent of armed police officers was seen arriving at the scene. The area OCS was spotted holding a brief conversation with some of the residents before leaving the scene.
Despite police intervention, the locals have since pledged to continue demonstrating until justice is served for the teenage girl. However, police have since launched investigations into the matter.
The protests in Kasarani came a day after residents of Thome Estate in Nairobi also staged demonstrations to demand justice for a young man who was allegedly murdered on Wednesday night under unclear circumstances.
Angry residents barricaded roads within the area, accusing law enforcement officers of allegedly attempting to cover up the murder of the young man, whose body was found on Thursday morning.

Fake Lawyer Nabbed After Running Law Firm for Almost 7 Years,"An individual purporting to be a lawyer has been arrested after running an organisation for almost seven years, along with a law firm in Uasin Gishu County.
The suspect was found to be operating a human rights organisation and offering legal services without any legal qualifications.
In a press briefing, Law Society of Kenya (LSK) Council Member Steve Mbugua said that the operation was carried out on June 19, with the help of police officers.
""The individual whom we have arrested has been here for more than 7 years. Running an organisation in the disguise of a human rights organisation,” he said.

The arrest was made after LSK received reports from the members of the public and LSK's local leadership.
Mbugua said during the operation, vital documents were recovered, including files of ongoing court cases.
“It is unfortunate that we have recovered very critical documents, which have been drafted by persons who are not qualified.""
“We have come here to collect the evidence that this individual has been running a law firm where they have been purporting to lawyer preparing legal documents and agreements, which is contrary to the law,"" Mbugua said.
Mbugua said the individual has been conning members of the public by pretending to be a lawyer and drafting crucial documents.
He issued a stern warning to others who may be illegally practising law. This arrest comes as part of the ongoing nationwide crackdown on fake lawyers.
Earlier on June 5, five other people were arrested for pretending to be lawyers and operating for 13 years in Bungoma.
LSK said that the local security agency revealed that the suspects had been running four different law firms.

Tenants Stranded as Nairobi County Begins Evictions in Buruburu,"Tenants from Buruburu Estate in Nairobi County have blamed the county leadership for allegedly sending goons to forcefully evict them from the county-owned houses despite settling rent arrears.
Speaking on Friday, the residents revealed that the evictions began earlier this week, leaving dozens of families stranded, with their personal belongings thrown out, embezzled, and damaged while they watched helplessly.
According to the residents, goons posing as county officials broke into their houses, looted their valuables, and even went to the extreme of wearing their clothes and parading around the estates.
“I had just left City Hall when I got a call. By the time I returned, my house had been broken into, my bags taken, and strangers were walking around with my clothes. I had already paid my rent, and I dont understand why this is happening,” one of the residents who has lived in the houses expressed her frustrations.

According to the residents, the county is using intimidation tactics to reclaim the houses. Most of them have decried foul play, alleging that despite paying the rents, they are still being forced out.
Several tenants say they were not served with formal notices and were caught off guard by the sudden operation.
Efforts to seek help and stop the evictions have also remained futile, as estate officers and housing officials have reportedly distanced themselves from the operations.
“When we asked the estate officer, he said he didn’t know what was going on. Even the housing director claimed he was in the dark,” said another tenant.
Another resident raised tough questions to the county after alleging that they had been told they were removed from the system, leaving them wondering to whom they had been paying rent if they had been removed from the system.
They also raised concerns that the houses had already been allocated to new owners who had paid up to Ksh2.5 million and were awaiting to move in.
“There are very credible sources saying these houses have been allocated to others, with prices reaching up to Ksh2.5 million,” another resident who has stayed in the houses for over 30 years revealed.
The evictions come amidst an ongoing crackdown by Nairobi County as it seeks to recover rent arrears from tenants in county-owned estates. So far, the evictions have been undertaken in Woodley, Kariobangi South, Kariakor, Ngara, Uhuru Estate, New Pumwani, Lumbumba, Maringo, and Ofafa Jericho.

Govt Finally Secures Billions For Construction of 580 Key Roads,"The government, through the Ministry of Transport, has announced the resumption of the construction of over 580 stalled roads across the country, months after suffering a cash crunch.
This follows the Ministry of Transport securing Ksh175 billion in loans from private investors to clear money owed to contractors and complete the stalled road projects.
The ministry explained that the funds were raised through the partial securitisation of revenue from the Road Maintenance Levy Fund (RMLF), which is money obtained from fuel purchases.
Securitisation is a financial mechanism that allows an institution to raise money in the form of bond sales, which would later be offset using proceeds from collected levies.

Rather than taking on a traditional loan or waiting for funds to accumulate slowly over time for the government to use in road construction, the institution bundles a portion of its expected cash flow and sells it to investors.
To address the issue of stalled roads across the country and pay pending bills, the government raised Ksh175 billion from investors and committed Ksh7 out of every Ksh25 per litre of fuel levy collected to refund the investors for the next ten years.
""This commitment was handed over to a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), which raised Ksh175 billion upfront from private investors,"" the ministry announced.
""The investors will be repaid directly from the fuel levy, not from the government budget over the years. Kenya Roads Board bears no risk of revenue shortfalls,"" it added.
In its communiqué, the ministry clarified that the funds acquired from investors would not, in any way, raise the price of fuel; rather, it would help curb further increases in fuel prices.
According to the ministry, this is because if fuel consumption drops or the collection of the fuel levy underperforms, it is the investors who would bear the losses as per the deal.
Among the roads currently under construction after the multi-billion shilling funding is the dualling of the Mombasa–Mtwapa road, which is set to be expanded for Ksh7.5 billion.
The 13.5 kilometre stretch is currently 42 per cent complete and is expected to enhance regional connectivity, boost trade, and stimulate tourism.

EACC Recovers 12 Parcels of Grabbed Land Worth Millions,"The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) has recovered 12 parcels of grabbed public land worth Ksh320 million.
In a statement released on Friday, June 20, the anti-graft body revealed that the recovered prime parcels had been grabbed in Bungoma and Kakamega counties.
According to the EACC, the land in question had consisted of government houses and was acquired by private individuals in collusion with public officials.
The recovered parcels are believed to be just the tip of the iceberg, as the EACC revealed that land grabbing remains a prevalent issue in Western Kenya.

Addressing a joint forum of members from the Regional, County, and Sub-County Security Committees in Western Kenya, the EACC Western Regional Manager revealed that there were increasing cases of public land grabbing in the region by private developers who use fraudulently acquired title deeds to secure loans.
To that effect, the Commission disclosed that it was pursuing 56 more illegally acquired parcels of land belonging to the State Department for Housing, the Judiciary, the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority, Kenya Railways, and the National Treasury in the region.
Speaking at the forum, Western Regional Commissioner Samson Macharia urged administrative officers to take responsibility for ensuring efficient service in their areas of command.
In addition, he urged the security chiefs to join efforts with the EACC in tackling corruption and bribery at service delivery points, which he termed as the biggest obstacle to service delivery.
The latest comes after President William Ruto had in February this year ordered a major crackdown on land grabbers across the country. This was part of the stringent measures to reduce the large-scale displacement of people from their rightful property.
Speaking in Kwale on Tuesday, February 25, Ruto ordered security agencies in each county to enforce the law against fraudulent landowners.
While issuing 6,247 title deeds to residents of three sub-counties in Kwale, Ruto also reaffirmed the government’s commitment to securing land tenure for all Kenyans.
While directing the immediate arrest of all land grabbers, the Head of State emphasised that no Kenyan should be deprived of their rightful land.
""I warn those who take other people’s land, this will not be allowed. No Kenyan should be deprived of their rightful land. I call upon security agencies to act because land grabbing is unconstitutional,"" Ruto declared.
""We will not allow a few individuals to take other people's land through fraudulent means. There is nowhere the law allows an individual to invade another person's land so that the government can compensate them,"" he added.
