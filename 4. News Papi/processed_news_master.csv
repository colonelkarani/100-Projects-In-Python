Murkomen Announces New Police Recruitment Guidelines,Musk'o' Revolves Makes Recruitment Tips Easier to Handle!,"Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen has announced a sweeping reform agenda aimed at restoring professionalism, discipline, and service excellence in the National Police Service (NPS).
Central to the reform is a new policy that will see the recruitment of specialised officers who will bring modern ideas to promote professionalism within the service.
Speaking at Harambee House on Monday, June 16, Murkomen admitted the need for extensive reforms, adding that the fresh recruitment would go a long way in establishing modern police standards amid a wave of criticism that has rocked the service in recent times.
""In our upcoming police recruitment, we shall include a specific cadre of specialised officers to infuse fresh talent, professionalism and modern police standards throughout the service,"" Murkomen said.

The CS also announced that all police officers currently in the force would be subjected to regular assessments to elevate the entire force through regular and standardised professional development
“I have directed the establishment of Continuous Professional Development (CPD) training for all officers, beginning with the OCSs,” he went on.
“This training will be based on a curriculum aligned with the constitutional values and standards of the National Police Service.”
While emphasising the importance of sustained investment in training, the CS also subtly aimed a dig at the National Treasury, lamenting that police training was often the first casualty in the event of budget cuts. 
Murkomen's reforms were brought about by pressure following the controversy surrounding the death of blogger Albert Ojwang.
Besides reforms on the recruitment of officers, Murkomen also issued a directive requiring each police station to have functional CCTV surveillance systems, including live monitoring accessible by the Officer Commanding Station (OCS). The footage must be backed up securely to aid future investigations.
In March 2025, more reforms on recruitment were announced by Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja, who told the Senate Committee on National Cohesion, Equal Opportunity and Regional Integration that police officer recruitments will be done online.
While responding to a question by the committee, IG Kanja revealed that it was necessary to change the recruitment process to curb fraud cases

DIG Lagat Steps Aside,dig lagat's contributions have become legibly timeless,"Deputy Inspector General of Police Eliud Lagat has stepped aside as the investigations into the murder of a teacher and blogger, Albert Ojwang, continue.
Lagat has stepped aside pending the conclusion of investigations of Ojwang, who died while in police custody at the Central Police Station in Nairobi. 
In a statement issued on Monday, the embattled police boss confirmed his decision to step aside, noting that it was a personal and moral decision aimed at ensuring the integrity of the investigations.
""In the good and conscious thought of my role and responsibilities as the Deputy Inspector General of the Kenya Police Service, and given the ongoing investigations on the unfortunate incident of the death of Albert Ojwang, I have today opted to step aside from the office of the Deputy Inspector General—Kenya Police Service pending completion of investigations. The functions of the office will henceforth be performed by my deputy until completion of the investigations,'' Lagat stated.

Lagat, who took office in 2024, succeeding Kanja, who was promoted to the Inspector General position, committed to supporting ongoing investigations to see that justice is served. 
""I undertake to provide any support that may be required of me during the investigations of the unfortunate incident. I offer immense condolences to the family of Albert Ojwang for their great loss.''
His deputy is set to take over his role temporarily pending the outcomes of the investigations that have since sparked uproar. 
The move comes in the wake of mounting calls from human rights groups, civil society, and a section of lawmakers demanding accountability and transparency in the case. Over the past week, protests have been planned across major towns, with demonstrators calling for justice and an overhaul of police leadership implicated in custodial deaths.
In his current role, Lagat is mandated to oversee the day-to-day administration and operations of the Kenya Police Service, overseeing coordination, supervision, training, and internal oversight within the unit.
Before his DIG role, he was the Commandant of the General Service Unit (GSU) since 2023, an elite unit within the National Police Service.
Prior to the role, he served as the Director of Reforms at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) headquarters in 2022, and before that, he was the Head of the Bomb and Hazardous Materials Unit at the bureau.
The developments come hours after former Chief Justice David Maraga had demanded the arrest of the Inspector General of Police, Douglas Kanja, his deputy, Lagat, and the Director of Criminal Investigations, Mohammed Amin, over the death of the influencer.
Speaking to journalists on Monday, June 16, the former CJ demanded that the arrests be made before June 25, failure to which he would join Kenyans in engaging in private prosecution against the three.

"Job Scare for Over 31,000 Civil Servants in Privatization Scheme","The job scare is affecting over 31,000 civil servants in its privatization scheme.","Narok Senator Ledama Ole Kina has proposed the privatization of all prison facilities in the country, signalling alarm among staff working with the Kenya Prisons Service (KPS).
If prisons are privatized, it means that the private investors may decide to lay off some workers if the investor wants to cut costs or restructure, erase roles that are deemed unnecessary, or the workers reject the new terms. This could spell doom for the over 31,000 uniformed and auxiliary staff working for the agency in 140 prisons around the country.
However, in a statement on his official X account on Monday, June 16, the lawmaker claimed that the privatization of the facilities will restore dignity in prisons.
According to Ledama, after the facilities have been privatized, the mistreatment of prisoners will come to an end, and they will also have access to better healthcare and food, just like any other Kenyan.

""It's high time Kenya privatizes all its prisons. Even those who have committed crimes are human beings and should be treated as such! They deserve access to proper medical care and nutritious food,"" the lawmaker said.
Kenya's prison system comprises 140 prisons, which include 134 institutions for adult offenders and 6 for youthful offenders.
According to data from the KPS, the current prisoner population in Kenya stands at 54,000, of whom 48 per cent are pre-trial detainees, whilst the remaining ones are sentenced prisoners.
This marks the second time in the past seven months the government has proposed reforms in the correction service in a bid to ensure the humane treatment of prisoners.
According to the State Department for Correctional Services, in its Strategic Plan 2023-2027, the government aims to equip correctional facilities with more healthcare centres and medics to ensure that both the staff and the inmates receive quality healthcare.
Additionally, the government revealed plans to establish specialised mental health treatment wings in every prison to combat mental health challenges among inmates.
Furthermore, the state department claimed that over 11,000 uniformed officers and 600 probation officers will be recruited and trained during the plan period, to reinforce security in these facilities.
“The State Department enhanced capacity development through recruiting, training, and deploying 11,527 uniformed officers, 233 Civilian staff (chaplains), and 600 probation officers,” part of the plan stated.

Murkomen Reveals When DIG Lagat Will Resign,Discover When DIG Lagat Might Depart from the Team!,"Deputy Inspector General Eliud Lagat will not be resigning anytime soon, according to Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen.
Speaking at a press briefing on Monday, June 16, the CS relayed that investigations by the Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA) into the Albert Ojwang killing were still ongoing, and so far, no tangible reason had been unearthed justifying the resignation of the man, just a heartbeat away from leading the police force.
Lauding the DIG as a seasoned police officer, Murkomen assured that if he were to be implicated down the road, the police service would ""cross the bridge"" when they get there.
""On whether or not he (DIG Lagat) should resign, I would like to say that the investigation has already been ongoing with IPOA,"" he stated.

""DIG Lagat is a seasoned police officer who understands what it takes to carry out matters of investigations and whether or not his conduct or act, or position can affect that investigation, and I think we will cross the bridge when we reach there.""
Recusing himself from making the decision for the DIG, he stated that the IPOA would ultimately decide whether the DIG's position was a hindrance to its investigations, as he was still helping with the investigation as the complainant in the case that landed Ojwang at Central Police Station, where he passed away.
For over a week now, there has been public uproar over DIG Lagat still holding office after making the complaint, with many convinced he had a part to play in the alleged killing of Ojwang in police custody.
Following Ojwang's passing, the National Police Service confirmed that the DIG had sought the help of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) over the blogger tarnishing his name on social media.
Consequently, calls for his resignation flooded the airwaves and social media, something that his boss, Inspector General Douglas Kanja, was quick to dismiss during a parliamentary probe over the matter.
Just a few hours before Murkomen's presser, former Chief Justice David Maraga called for the arrest and prosecution of the DIG, IG Kanja and DCI boss Mohammed Amin before June 25, or protests would break out and Kenyans would demand private prosecution of the trio for lying under oath.
Although the DIG will not be resigning soon, the CS also announced an overhaul in several policies as a result of Ojwang's death, including the mandatory installation of CCTV cameras in all 1,209 police stations within the next two years, with a secure backup to aid in future investigations.
This system will also include live monitoring accessible by the Officer Commanding Station (OCS), who will be held accountable in case the surveillance system is tampered with.
He also announced the planned digitisation of the Occurrence Book reports in all police stations within the year.

Murkomen Makes Immediate Changes in Police Service,Murmkin Makes Significant Impacts on Police Service,"Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen has ordered a raft of reforms targeting police stations across the country, key among them the mandatory installation of CCTV cameras in all stations within the next two years.
Under the new directive, each police station will be required to have functional CCTV surveillance systems, including live monitoring accessible by the Officer Commanding Station (OCS). The footage must be backed up securely to aid future investigations.
Murkomen further directed that all instances of assault or misconduct within stations be reported within an hour, with the CCTV systems expected to play a central role in ensuring accountability.
This will be rolled out across all 1209 police stations in Kenya, with Parliament set to enact legislation that criminalises the deletion of CCTV footage.

Additionally, the CS announced the full digitisation of Occurrence Books (OBs) across all police stations in a year. He said this would ensure that every report filed can be tracked, audited, and verified in real time to eliminate tampering and increase transparency.
Adding to these changes, Murkomen announced a community-focused integration plan to improve public trust and service delivery. He revealed that police operations will undergo regular independent audits to assess effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. High-performing officers and stations will be publicly recognised and rewarded.
''Officers will be required to work together with civil groups, religious groups, and local communities, and this shall undergo regular evaluation to see who is adhering to the set protocols,'' he directed.
To anchor the reforms, the CS directed the rollout of continuous development training, starting with OCSs, who will undertake minimum constitutional and professional conduct courses aimed at enhancing discipline, rights-based policing, and efficient service delivery.
“I have directed that continuous development training begin immediately, starting with OCSs, who will undergo minimum constitutional training to improve professionalism and accountability in the police service,” Murkomen stated.
Parliament and the Treasury will be working closely with his ministry to avail funds for the training exercises according to the outspoken CS. However, the CS decried cosntant budget cuts highlighting that training was the most affected. 
Meanwhile, Murkomen highlighted challenges in implementing Article 244 of the Constitution, which defines the objectives and functions of the National Police Service. He noted that the article demands high standards of professionalism, discipline, and strict adherence to human rights, areas where gaps persist.
Nevertheless, pressure continues to mount on the CS to direct Deputy Inspector General of Police Eliud Lagat to step aside over the ongoing investigation. However, the CS has insisted that the due legal process must be followed.
Meanwhile, social media platforms have been flooded with calls for protests scheduled for Tuesday, with demonstrators expected to demand Lagat’s resignation over his alleged connection to the circumstances surrounding the death of blogger Albert Ojwang while in police custody.

Drama in Court as Lawyers Clash Over Death of Albert Ojwang,Bewitching drama as lawyers clash over Albert Ojwang's demise,"There was drama at the Milimani Law Court as a tense legal battle ensued between lawyers from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) and lawyers representing two police officers accused of playing a role in the death of teacher and blogger Albert Ojwang.
Tempers almost boiled over when Central Police Station, Nairobi, OCS Samson Talaam and Constable James Mukhwana, through their lawyer Danstan Omari, moved to petition the High Court to block their prosecution and a prayer to hold them in jail for 21 days.
Omari was adamant that the arrest of Talaam by the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) were not only premature but also legally flawed.
According to Omari, an inquest should have been held before any criminal proceedings were initiated against his clients.

When Omari stood to cross-examine Abdirahman Jibril, the Senior Assistant Director, Investigations of IPOA, who provided an affidavit defending the prayer to hold the two police officers for 21-days, tensions reached a breaking point. He wanted clarification on the legal foundations of the prayer.
Omari then went on to point out flaws in IPOA's affidavit, pointing out multiple contradictions that, in his opinion, rendered Talaam's prosecution incorrect.
""From your affidavit, confirm the place of death is Central Police Station. You have confirmed the scene of death is at the police cell,"" Omari argued.
Omari then referenced several points from IPOA's report tabled before the Senate last week, which the prosecution insisted was not in the affidavit presented in court on Monday.
With Omari clamping down on prosecution, prosecution urged restraint, saying, ""We plead with our colleagues to remain respectful. What we are asking is, as the court has suggested, to put the law to the witness. Don't ask the witness to refer to the law. We do not mind if you read the law to him and ask questions.""
Omari fired back with yet another pointed question: ""Give me the law that gives you (IPOA) the mandate to investigate the person who dies in a police cell.""
Caught off-guard, Abdirahman, said,  ""We did not anticipate that a witness of IPOA would be made to read the law. We didn’t carry a copy of the IPOA Act.""
Omari then accused the prosecution of practicing “selective amnesia when it suits their convenience,” drawing murmurs in the court.
The Director of Public Prosecution filed an application to detain OCS Talaam for an additional 21 days to allow IPOA to complete its investigation into Ojwang's suspicious death -  a move which was opposed by Omari.
While prosecution argued that Talaam's detention was for the safety of witnesses, Omari was adamant his client was not familiar with any witnesses.
""Do you need my client in cells for the purpose of analysing the phone? Is there any role he is required to play in forensic analysis?"" Omari further asked, leaving the prosecution lost for words.
""It's not only about phone analysis. It is to complete investigations,"" the prosecution, through Jibril, insisted.

As tensions escalated, Central Police Station, Samson Talaam and Constable James Mukhwana presented their case to the High Court, seeking to stop prosecution for 21 days or pray for jail time.  

Tensions reached a breaking point when Danstan Omari argued that IPOA’s inquest was flawed, citing multiple contradictions in the affidavit. The ODDP Senior Assistant Director, Abdirahman Jibril, questioned this and wondered if he could read the law himself.  

Omari countered with an attack on the prosecution’s stance, urging restraint. As Abdirahman suspected, he did not anticipate a witness to read the law, leading to further tension between parties. Despite the witness request for the IPOA act, the ODDP filed additional detention of Talaam, adding layers of complexity to the case.

ODPP Reveals Who Paid for Deletion CCTV After Blogger's Murder,ODPP Reveal: Who Paid to Delete the deleted video on CCTV after its blogger was murdered,"The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has accused embattled Nairobi Central Police Station OCS Samson Taalam of paying a technician to delete CCTV footage linked to the death of Albert Ojwang.
Appearing before the Milimani Law Courts, the DPP, through legal counsel, accused Taalam of interfering with crucial evidence in the ongoing investigation into Ojwang’s death in police custody. 
Last week, it emerged that a technician was paid Ksh3,000 to delete the crucial footage that is said to be important in piecing together what happened to the blogger while in police custody. It was not immediately made public who paid for the deletion of the CCTV footage.
However, the prosecution on Monday, claimed that Taalam, as the custodian of station records and surveillance systems, allegedly contracted the technician to tamper with the CCTV footage at the station in what is believed to be a deliberate attempt to obstruct justice.

“There are witnesses, particularly police officers who were on duty on the material day, who are yet to be interviewed and have their statements recorded. Given the respondent’s position as OCS, there is a high likelihood that he will interfere with these potential witnesses,” the DPP stated.
While making their prayer to hold Talaam for 21 days, the government accused the OCS of paying the suspect to tamper with the footage. The man accused of deleting the CCTV footage is said to have been arrested on the morning of Friday, June 13, in a supposed targeted operation at his residence in a populous Nairobi estate.
According to sources privy to the situation, the technician, who had overseen the installation of all 25 cameras at the station in 2024, was called just past 6am on Saturday, June 8, by a police officer at Central Police Station. Aside from the cameras, the man also installed a digital video recorder (DVR) where all captured footage is stored.
The man claims that the officer urged him to report to the station immediately. Upon arrival, he was taken to the office of a senior officer, where the DVR is housed, and was allegedly asked to delete footage from Thursday, June 6, and Friday, June 7, and was paid Ksh3,000.
Talam has been in custody since his arrest on Friday in Eldoret. According to reports, police claimed he had gone into hiding before he was tracked down and handed over to the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) for further interrogation.
IPOA filed an application seeking to detain Taalam for 21 days to allow completion of investigations into the murder of Ojwang.
The arrest came after DCI Director General Amin Mohamed told a Senate inquiry that Talam was the prime person of interest in the murder of Albert Ojwang, citing his position of command at the station where the influencer died.
“It has further been confirmed that before the booking, the report office personnel called the OCS, who declined to book the suspect. Talam is the Officer Commanding Central Police Station,” Amin told the committee.

Medics Throw Fresh Headache to Govt,Medics Throw Dilemma to Mood,"The Kenya National Union of Medical Laboratory Officers (KNUNMLO) has strongly opposed the newly proposed Quality Healthcare and Patient Safety Bill.
According to the Public Health Principal Secretary, Mary Muthoni, in a statement on Sunday, June 8, the bill, which is open for public participation between June 23 to 27, will ensure that healthcare facilities across the country maintain the highest medical standards while offering services to patients.
If the bill sails through and becomes law, healthcare providers who are caught mismanaging patients will be subjected to fines of up to Ksh50 million and jail terms of up to 10 years.
Additionally, all private and government-owned facilities will be required to adhere to set standards, which include maintaining proper sanitation, lighting, ventilation, water and food safety, enforcing anti-abuse policies, and providing adequate patient nutrition.

The bill also proposes the erection of a Quality Healthcare and Patient Safety Authority, which will take over the role of registering, licensing, and accrediting health facilities, overseeing their operations nationwide.
However, in a statement on  Monday, June 17, the Union claims that the bill will compromise professional independence, patient safety, and the integrity of the country's healthcare system.
According to KNUMLO, the government aims to centralise the regulation of the country's healthcare system, which will, as a result, bring the country's healthcare under political and commercial control.
According to the medics, the bill is a plot by cartels to privately control the Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF), which they claim has deepened their influence at the Ministry of Health.
""This Bill is not about reform—it is about control and money. It aims to hijack the Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF) and shift regulatory authority to politically connected actors for private gain,"" the statement read.
""Even more disturbing is the secrecy around this Bill. Its authors remain hidden while clearly working to dismantle professional regulation and remove public oversight,"" it added. 
Additionally, the Union claimed that creating a new authority to take over the mandate of registering and licensing healthcare facilities would undermine the role of the Kenya Accreditation Service (KENAS), which is currently responsible for accrediting health facilities in the country.
""We are deeply concerned about the growing influence of cartels in the Ministry of Health, who appear to have captured Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale,"" it stated.

PHOTO MINISTRY OF HEALTH","The Kenya National Union of Medical Laboratory Officers (KNUNMLO) has firmly opposed the newly proposed Quality Healthcare and Patient Safety Bill, which is set to take effect after public participation between June 23 and 27. If it passes, healthcare providers caught mismanaging patients will face severe consequences: fines up to Ksh50 million and potentially jail terms of up to ten years.  

Additionally, all healthcare facilities across Kenya must adhere to stringent standards including proper sanitation, lighting, ventilation, water safety, food safety, anti-abuse policies, and adequate patient nutrition. This bill aims to create a dedicated authority for registering and licensing health facilities, overseeing their operations nationwide.  

The proposed Quality Healthcare and Patient Safety Authority will oversee healthcare facilities by ensuring they meet national standards. However, the Kenya National Accreditation Service (KENAS) is at risk if this initiative is successful, as it is currently responsible for accrediting facilities.  

Meanwhile, the bill seeks to centralise healthcare regulation under the ownership of political figures, which could mean losing public oversight and control over services. This move aims to control the Ministry of Health's Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF), which the KNUNLO claims has deepened their influence.","In a lush field setting, an old farmer stands, his eyes scanning past the fields of Kenya where an old farmer is surrounded by old wooden plows and young medical workers in white uniforms.

How Govt Intends to Use Ksh4 Billion in Ruto's New Project,Ruto's New Project Highlights Ksh4 Billion Allocation.,"The government, through the Ministry of Agriculture, will be investing Ksh4 billion through the Sugar Development Levy (SDL) to support the sugar industry.
This announcement was made by the Agriculture Cabinet Secretary, Mutahi Kagwe, when he visited the West Kenya Sugar Company on Monday, June 16, just weeks after the company took over the control of the Nzoia Sugar Company.
In a contentious takeover, the group signed a 30-year lease with the government in a move expected to revive the state-owned mill and bring stability to the sector.
While unveiling the fund, CS Kagwe stated that it was intended to support sustainable growth across the entire sugar industry, not just a single player.

“These investments are designed to secure the long-term sustainability of the sugar industry,” CS Kagwe said.
Of the Ksh4 billion annual investment plan, 40 per cent, which is about Ksh2 billion, will be utilised in cane development programs across the country. 
The rest, 60 per cent will go towards the development of other strategic sectors meant to grow the sugar industry positively.
For instance, 15 per cent—about Ksh600 million—will be used in the rehabilitation of roads in sugarcane-growing regions.
Another Ksh600 million will go to research and innovation for improved industry productivity, and yet another one to factory rehabilitation across the sector.
5 per cent of the fund, which is around Ksh200 million, will be utilised to strengthen farmer associations, and the last 10 per cent will go to administrative operations under the Sugar Board.
During the visit, the CS further commended West Kenya Sugar for implementing policies that favour farmers, including weekly payments to over 120,000 contracted farmers. 
He also highlighted the company disburses over Ksh14 billion annually in farmer payments and invests an additional Ksh7 billion annually in cane development initiatives.
The Rai Sugar Group, which manages the company, reportedly manages nearly 50 per cent of the land under sugarcane cultivation in Kenya.

IMF Sends Officials to Kenya Amid Fresh Protests,**IMF Sends New Officials to Kenya Amid Fresh Protests (✨)**,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is set to survey the impact of corruption on public finances in the country over the next two weeks in a bid to pave the way for a new financial support agreement.
According to reports from Bloomberg, the team from the IMF will scrutinise the effectiveness of Kenya's anti-corruption legal and institutional framework, in addition to examining graft risks in fiscal and central bank governance, the rule of law, and market regulations.
According to an IMF spokesperson, the 14-day study will be foundational in enabling the government to reinforce its anti-corruption capacity before it enters into a new funding agreement with the lender.
The planned engagement with the IMF reflects Kenya’s search for new financing in a bid to stabilise to stimulate economic growth, a factor that has recurrently triggered protests in the country.

""The review is part of the IMF’s commitment to helping strengthen governance and anti-corruption frameworks,” an IMF spokesperson told the publication.
According to Bloomberg, the team will then relay the findings of their study to the Kenyan government and publish thereafter after a green light from the state.
In March 2025, Kenya decided not to proceed with the 9th review, foregoing an estimated $800 million disbursement, to open talks for a new funding arrangement.
 The IMF’s Executive Board completed the 7th and 8th reviews of Kenya’s $3.6 bn Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and Extended Credit Facility (ECF), along with a Resilience & Sustainability Facility (RSF), unlocking around $606 million in new funding.
In May 2025, an IMF staff-level agreement was reached for a Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) loan worth Ksh75.3 billion. This funding is conditional on climate and green reforms and is expected to be disbursed in early November.
Speaking on Wednesday, June 11, the CBK Governor Kamau Thugge confirmed that the country had penned a letter to the IMF requesting to negotiate a new arrangement.
“We are indeed having discussions with the IMF, and the government did send a letter to the IMF requesting to negotiate a new arrangement. We are expecting an IMF team to come in September to start discussions on the Article IV consultation,” the Governor said.
According to Thugge, the team conducts an in-depth assessment of the country's economic and financial policies and a debt sustainability analysis.

Kenya Clarifies Sending Weapons to Sudan After NTV Exposé,Kenya communicates with Sudan about transfers from a:n weapon database after detecting suspicious activity.,"Kenya has denied sending arms used in the hostilities in the neighbouring Sudan, distancing itself from allegations raised in a recent exposé by NTV.
Government Spokesperson Isaac Mwaura dismissed claims that Kenya supplied illicit weapons to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), stating that the country’s role in Sudan is strictly limited to humanitarian assistance and support for peace processes. “Kenya is supporting the peace process through IGAD. Any other assertion is mere conjecture. We have no business with the claims being made out there,” he said.
Mwaura, speaking during a press briefing in Nairobi, further stated that Kenya, like any sovereign nation, is free to engage in legitimate trade partnerships, adding that the allegations being circulated have no factual basis.
He revealed that the government had donated Ksh256 million (approximately USD 2 million) to aid Sudan’s ongoing peace initiatives and support humanitarian interventions for civilians affected by the conflict.

Reaffirming Kenya’s neutral stance, Mwaura emphasised that the country remains non-aligned and is willing to host both the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and the RSF to facilitate peace talks.
He also called for a harmonised peace framework involving the African Union and United Nations, similar to the Ushirika model adopted in South Sudan.
The allegations against Kenya emerged from a joint investigation by NTV and open-source intelligence platform Bellingcat, which revealed images of Kenyan-labelled ammunition crates allegedly found in a captured RSF depot near Sudan’s capital, Khartoum.
While the contents of every crate could not be independently verified, nearby ammunition matching the labels indicating arms either bought or sent to Kenya for the Ministry of Defence, was displayed by the Sudanese Armed Forces in the now viral videos.
In response, the Ministry of Defence denied any connection to the weapons saying it could not identify the crates. “Upon examination of the photographs provided, we wish to state that we do not recognise the crates nor the inscriptions on them,” the ministry to Nation.
According to the probe by the two institutions, the ministry appeared to address only domestically manufactured arms and did not clarify whether Kenya had made any weapons imports, exports, or transfers that might explain the presence of the crates in Sudan, leaving critical questions about the alleged link unanswered.
On March 14, the government of Sudan suspended all imports from Kenya following the latter's decision to host the RSF, a rebel group currently fighting the Sudanese army for control of the country.
Sudan announced the immediate restriction of all imports from Kenya, barring entry via ports, railways, and air transport.
""The import of all products from Kenya via all ports, crossings, airports, and entry points is suspended starting from this date until further notice,"" read part of the letter by Sudan's Acting Minister of Trade and Supplies, Omar Ahmed Mohamed Ali.
The Acting Minister stated that the decision was due to Kenya's defiant act of hosting and sponsoring the rebel group in Nairobi, adding that the move was aimed at protecting Sudan’s national interests and security.

As part of its efforts to maintain peace in the conflict-ridden region, Kenya supports the International General cease and Disposal (IGAD) program, which facilitates humanitarian assistance through aid operations. The country also provides humanitarian support for civilians affected by the conflict.

The government emphasized that Kenya's involvement with Sudan is limited to humanitarian assistance and does not involve arms supplies. However, Kenya donated approximately KD 256 million to aid Sudan's peace initiatives, including humanitarian interventions for civilians displaced by the conflict.

In response to allegations circulating from a joint investigation involving NTV and open-source intelligence platform Bellingcat, Kenya clarified its neutral stance. The organization uncovered images of Kenyan-labeled ammunition crates found in a captured RSF depot in Khartoum, suggesting potential links between Sudan's armed forces and Kenya. Despite this, the Ministry of Defense denied any connection to the weapons and did not confirm whether Kenya had made any imports or exports of arms that could explain the presence of these crates.

The allegations emerged from a joint investigation involving NTV and Bellingcat, which highlighted inconsistencies in reporting regarding Kenya's involvement with Sudan. The South-Sudan model for a harmonized peace framework was also referenced as part of the international collaboration between Kenya and the African Union (AU) with the United Nations (UN). The government has stated that it will not comment on specific allegations but will continue to engage with the international community on issues related to the conflict.","Kenya's neutral approach despite allegations of arms supply from Sudan, focused on humanitarian aid, with donations aimed at peace efforts, depicted in a calm scene with a conflict element.",generated_images\news_7ba50d5d.png,https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/113159-kenya-denies-arming-sudan-opens-doors-host-saf-rsf-peace-talks,7ba50d5d6cf47d7b026e364fd5d03f2c,2025-06-16T18:13:04.397023
Why You Could Soon be Arrested for Selling to Street Families,This Problem Could Be Solved Now: Selling to Street Families,"Nairobi County Chief Environment Officer Geoffrey Mosiria has announced that his department will soon begin cracking down on vendors selling jet fuel and other harmful substances to street families.
In a statement on Sunday night, Mosiria relayed that this was in a bid to clear street families out of the Nairobi central business district (CBD).
""We have also begun raids on those selling jet fuel and other harmful substances to street families,"" he stated during a routine CBD inspection.
He added that he would be collaborating with the National Authority for the Campaign Against Drug Abuse (NACADA) for enforcement in eradicating the rampant use of drugs and other harmful substances among street families.

As such, he urged good Samaritans willing to help these families to desist from giving them cash but buy them essentials like food instead. This, he said, could also deter fake beggars who pose as street families to attract empathy from do-gooders.
""We have started an operation to remove street families from our streets because some pretend to be homeless and beg for money. When offered support to go home, to rehabilitation centres, or shelters, they often refuse, being used to free cash on the streets,"" he stated.
""I urge anyone who wants to help not to give cash but to buy food and encourage them to return home or connect them with homes for the homeless. Giving money only fuels drug peddlers who sell substances to these vulnerable people in the CBD.""
Mosiria was speaking after rescuing a street family member from an angry mob after he was caught attempting to steal recently installed bins in the CBD.
Other street families present during the altercation also expressed anger at the man, stating that his theft could have the families booted from the streets.
This move is the latest by the chief officer, who, during a recent CBD patrol, came across a mother with a young child claiming they had been abandoned by the child's mother, an assertion that turned out to be a ruse.
After paying for the woman's fare back home upcountry, the woman reportedly split the amount with the driver and refused to partake in the journey.
This revelation has now fuelled Mosiria's latest mission to drive fake homeless people from the streets who, especially, exploit children in a bid to attract empathy from unwitting Kenyans and get free money from them.

Wajackoyah's Plan to Stop DIG Lagat From Fleeing Kenya,Call Your Hand: Wajackoyah Protests to Stop Dig Lagat From Fleeting Kenyan Territory!,"Former presidential aspirant George Wajackoyah has vowed to petition the international community to impose a travel ban on Deputy Inspector General of Police Eliud Lagat over what he termed as interference and the mishandling of investigations into the death of blogger Albert Ojwang.
Speaking during a live interview on NTV on Monday, Wajackoyah—a lawyer with practices in both Kenya and the UK — said he would leverage his international legal networks to lobby the European Union and US lawmakers to restrict Lagat and his family from travelling abroad unless he steps aside.
“I will personally contact the EU. I practice law in the UK and the EU. I will write to US congressmen to ensure this man does not leave the country unless he steps down,” said Wajackoyah.
When questioned why he would not allow Kenya’s legal institutions to handle the matter, Wajackoyah, a former police officer, dismissed the local justice system as compromised and incapable of delivering justice for Ojwang’s family.

“The criminal justice system in this country does not work—has never worked, and will never work. We are turning to the West because that is the only way justice can be served, unless we borrow a leaf from Burkina Faso,” he declared.
He further criticised the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) for what he termed a lukewarm response to the case and demanded the resignation of both DIG Lagat and Interior CS Kipchumba Murkomen, accusing them of inaction and failing to uphold accountability.
However, Wajackoyah sought to absolve the Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja, from the mess, maintaining that he had nothing to do with the mess at the Central Police Station and the circumstances surrounding the demise of Ojwang. 
Further, Wajackoyah took a swipe at the Kenya Kwanza administration, accusing President William Ruto’s government of inefficiency and poor leadership. He argued that many individuals appointed to critical positions lacked the moral authority and integrity required to serve Kenyans effectively.
Recalling his days as a police officer stationed at the Central Police Station, Wajackoyah claimed he could detect insincerity from experience and intuition, alleging that Lagat’s conduct—including his body language during recent public briefings—betrayed a deeper truth about the case. “I can read these things spiritually,” he remarked, insisting that the DIG, as an implicated party, cannot be trusted to oversee a credible investigation and should therefore step aside.
''I have been a police officer for so many years. I first started at Central Police Station as a police constable at the cell sentry. So I understand the dynamics in that station very well. The most dynamic thing here is that an accuser cannot become the judge, in this case, the DIG. He should have stepped aside,"" he added. 
On Monday 9, Kanja confirmed that the late influencer, who died while in police custody, was under investigation for allegedly defaming DIG Lagat.
Responding to questions from journalists during a press briefing at Central Police Station in Nairobi, Kanja revealed that the DIG had lodged a formal complaint against Ojwang, prompting his arrest and subsequent questioning.
On Wednesday last week, the police boss revealed details of the alleged posts that DIG Lagat had reported. He stated that the account, which had over 13,000 followers, had allegedly published false information accusing the DIG of involvement in corruption within the NPS.

Another Man Dies While in Police Custody,Another Man Perishes While in Police Custody – Click Here To Support The Law.,"Police in Homa Bay County have launched investigations into the death of a 36-year-old man under mysterious circumstances while in custody at Kipasi Police Post in Mbita.
The man, identified as Calvince Omondi Onditi, reportedly died by suicide on the morning of Sunday, June 15, just hours after his arrest around midnight. 
Police allege that he used his trousers to hang himself inside a holding room. Omondi, a fisherman at Ndhuru Beach, had allegedly been found trespassing in a goat pen before being apprehended by police after the area chief was alerted.
However, locals, family members, and leaders—including Suba North MP Millie Odhiambo—have disputed the police version of events, calling for a thorough probe.

Odhiambo, visibly angered, dismissed the suicide claims as unconvincing, likening the case to that of Albert Ojwang, another Homa Bay resident who died in suspicious circumstances after being picked up by police.
“These deaths in police cells cannot go on. Albert Ojwang’s case is still unresolved, and now they’ve killed Mr. Onditi in my constituency. Yet again, they’re pushing this stupid suicide narrative,” she stated.
“We were called and told that your brother is dead, and we were left in shock. How could this happen? You informed us he was taken to Mbita just hours earlier, and then this is what we find. When we arrived there, we found him hanging,” added a family member of Omondi.
A post-mortem examination is expected to be conducted at Homa Bay Teaching and Referral Hospital to determine the actual cause of death. At the hospital, Chief Executive Officer Vincent Oduor confirmed that Calvin’s body showed signs of injury.
“We expect that an autopsy will be conducted on the body, but just from an initial overview, we have observed strangulation marks on the neck. The noose, made from long trousers, is still intact, and the tongue is also bitten. So far, there are no other significant marks on the body apart from these,” Oduor stated.
Meanwhile, three civilians who had been detained at the Central Police Station, Nairobi, on the night of Ojwang's death have been arrested in connection with the case.
According to the Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA), the three were instructed by police officers at the station to torture Ojwang to death while in custody.
Although the reasons for their initial arrests have not been made public yet, they are said to have been released shortly after the influencer's death. Following IPOA's probe, they were re-arrested on Sunday and are currently being held separately at Kilimani, Muthangari, and Kileleshwa Police Stations.

Matatu Ferrying Students Overturns Along Thika Road,overthrew students on board from a ferry crossing thika road,"A 14-seater matatu ferrying school children overturned on Thika Road near Garden City in Nairobi on Monday morning, sparking panic among motorists during the morning rush hour.
The vehicle, which was reportedly speeding, lost control and landed on its roof, prompting swift rescue efforts from passersby and first responders. 
The matatu, painted in very bright pink, is said to have been travelling towards the TRM Mall direction when the accident occurred.
Videos and images obtained by Kenyans.co.ke showed the children safely seated by the roadside within the inner lane, though it remains unclear whether any of them sustained major injuries.

The accident occurred during the morning peak hours, and the injured students were rushed to the hospital for medical attention.
The crash triggered a heavy traffic snarl-up along Thika Road as police officers, local authorities, and boda boda riders coordinated rescue operations and worked to clear the wreckage.
The traffic jam stretched from Githurai 45 to the accident scene near Garden City Mall, affecting both lanes heading towards Nairobi’s central business district.
Notably, the van lacked the mandatory yellow paint required for vehicles transporting school children. Instead, it was painted pink—a violation that has reignited concerns over lax enforcement of transport safety regulations for school vehicles operating on major highways.
The National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) set strict guidelines for school transport vehicles to enhance the safety of learners on Kenyan roads. Among the key requirements is that all school buses must be painted in a distinct yellow colour (code FFD800) and clearly labelled “School Bus” on the front and rear.
In addition to the paint, the NTSA requires all such vehicles to be fitted with flashing red lights, a stop-signal arm, functional seatbelts, and a visible complaints hotline for the public to report reckless driving. Buses must also carry the phrase “DO NOT PASS WHEN RED LIGHTS ARE FLASHING” in bold letters at the rear.
The rules, part of NTSA’s broader school transport safety framework, are meant to ensure better visibility of school buses and standardise safety protocols across the country. The agency has warned of penalties for non-compliance, including fines, impounding of vehicles, and possible suspension of operating licences.
Between January and March 2025, Kenya recorded 1,139 road accident fatalities, according to data from the NTSA — a slight drop compared to the 1,166 deaths reported over the same period in 2024.

Babu Owino Claps Back at Nelson Amenya in Online Spat,"Babu Owino Shaken Back at Nelson Amenya in a Tremendous Online Spat with #SocialMedia, #NelsonAmenya, #BabuOwino","Embakasi East Member of Parliament Babu Owino has slammed Adani whistleblower Nelson Amenya over his remarks that he was lacking in legislative duties.
In a statement on Sunday, June 16, the MP highlighted four bills that he has sponsored and supported in Parliament despite Amenya claiming that he had not sponsored any visionary legislation.
According to the MP, he has sponsored the Legal Education (Amendment) Bill,2023, the Kenya School of Law (amendment) Bill,2023, the Higher Education Loans Board(amendment) Bill,2020 and supported the Social Workers Bill.
Citing an Infotrack poll in February, the MP also relayed that he had been ranked the best-performing MP countrywide, despite doing it all from the opposition party.

""I was ranked the best-performing MP in Kenya while in opposition. I may not be the best, but there is none better than me so far in the race. The rest are unworthy opponents,"" he stated.
The rift started on Sunday when Amenya disagreed with an X user who urged Nairobi residents to vote for Babu Owino to replace Governor Johnson Sakaja.
According to Amenya, Owino's record as Embakasi East MP was underwhelming, and so was his record in parliament.
For that reason, he asserted that Nairobi did not need ""another populist like Sakaja"" but a competent technocrat who understands systems, not just soundbites.
""Even if we set aside DJ Evolve's case and assess him purely on leadership merit, the record is underwhelming. What visionary legislation has he sponsored in Parliament?"" Amenya quipped.
""Has his constituency seen measurable change in poverty, unemployment, security, and youth engagement? What tangible progress has he delivered in education or healthcare?"" he added.
Although he has yet to declare his intentions for the Nairobi top seat, the MP has emerged as a fan favourite to replace Sakaja in the upcoming 2027 general elections.
He has also repeatedly bashed the Nairobi governor's administration every chance he gets, leaving little to the imagination that he is up to vie for the capital's top seat.

Despite Amenya's claims, Babu echoed a trend where MPs have consistently ranked among the best in Kenya despite opposing their party’s leadership. Now, the ongoing dispute with Nairobi Governor Sakaja highlights tensions over the future of the capital. Even if Sakaja's record is deemed sound, Babu has bashed his governor, leaving little room for Sakaja to win the top seat.

"One Dead, Several Trapped as Another Gold Mine Collapses",A Scourge of Dead and Trapped People as Another Gold Mine Collapses,"One person has been confirmed dead and scores of others are feared trapped after a gold mine collapsed at Kambi Karaya in West Pokot County on Sunday evening.
The incident comes barely a week after a similar tragedy in Karon village, Turkwel, where four people died and five others were injured following another gold mine collapse.
Just days earlier, six miners had also perished in a separate incident in the same region, raising alarm over the rapid rise in illegal mining activities.
Reports indicated that the miners had returned to the site at night using picks and hoes, unaware that the soil had become loose after excavators had dug the pit during the day.

Local authorities, led by the police and emergency response teams, are currently conducting rescue operations amid growing concerns over the frequency and scale of such accidents in West Pokot.
In response, the government has announced fresh measures to curb unregulated mining. The State Department of Mining has established a new county-level office in West Pokot to enhance oversight, licensing, and compliance enforcement.
“Previously, we had regional mining offices. Going forward, we’ve restructured them into county mining offices to better serve the people,” said David Onyancha, a senior mining official.
West Pokot Governor Simon Kachapin echoed the government’s efforts, noting, “As a county, we are setting up frameworks to ensure that our people can safely exploit these minerals. This is a county of hidden treasures—but they must be harnessed safely.”
The National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) on Monday last week halted all mining activities within the Kambi Karai and Lami Nyeusi regions along the River Turkwel in Sigor Constituency.
According to NEMA, the closure was necessitated by the numerous complaints it has been receiving on the illicit mining points along the River Turkwel in Turkana County and West Pokot County. 
Despite the area having over 200 gold mining sites, the sites were found to be operating without Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) licences, leaving deep holes and dirty waters along the river, making it unsuitable for domestic consumption.
""NEMA has today directed mining activities within the Kambi Karai and Lami Nyeusi region along River Turkwel in Sigor Constituency to stop further operations due to their negative environmental impacts,"" NEMA confirmed.

The collapse at Kambi Karaya in West Pokot County has left a profound loss for those affected—one person confirmed dead and several trapped. Just two days ago, another tragedy struck nearby in Karon village of Turkwel County, where four died and five were injured after a gold mine collapsed.

A third incident occurred six days earlier at a site in Sigor Constituency along River Turkwell in West Pokot, with six miners perished. Local authorities are conducting rescue efforts amid growing concerns about the frequent and severe issues in mining operations across the region.

The government is taking immediate action to address unregulated mining and has introduced new measures for county-level oversight. West Pokot Governor Simon Kachapin emphasized the importance of ensuring safe mining practices for local residents, emphasizing that each site must adhere to environmental regulations to avoid negative impacts on nearby ecosystems.

NEMA, responsible for managing the area, has halted all mining activities in Kambi Karai and Lami Nyeusi within Sigor Constituency along River Turkwel. This decision is due to numerous complaints regarding illicit mining, with concerns that these sites have long-term environmental issues that make them unsuitable for domestic use.

Police have launched rescue operations after a significant gold mine collapse in Turkwel. Local emergency teams responded on June 7, 2025, and images of all safety measures taken are available upon request.

Kindiki Threatens to Tackle Kalonzo Head-On Over Falsehoods,"Kindiki Might Attack Falsehoods, Stuck in the Mire, Potentially Facing Urgency","Deputy President Kithure Kindiki has responded to former Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka over his assertion that he is unwilling to work with the government.
In a statement on Sunday, June 15, the deputy president acknowledged the remarks but did not take kindly to the ""unkind words"" Kalonzo said about him.
On Sunday morning, Kalonzo described Kindiki as ""Mr Half term"", asserting that his invitation to join the ruling alliance was a diversionary tactic meant to destabilise the united opposition coalition.
As such, DP Kindiki stated that he would not engage the former VP in a public battle of words, as that was not his intention, maintaining that he still held the Wiper Party leader in high regard.

""I hear my big brother Kalonzo has said he doesn’t wish to work with me politically. That is fine with me. For the unkind things he has said about me, I won’t answer him back publicly, not because I can’t, but because I never do public duels with people  I respect,"" part of the statement read.
However, he revealed that despite his high regard for Kalonzo, he was not beyond indulging in a head-on confrontation with him if he did not stop spreading lies about him.
Despite the rejection by the opposition, however, he relayed that he would keep pushing the development agenda to work for all Kenyans.
""Nevertheless, if he continues with his falsehoods unprovoked, I will happily tackle him head-on. Respect is a two-way street. For now, Kalonzo will remain the good big brother I have known for decades,"" Kindiki stated.
""Meanwhile, the Government’s development agenda for all the people of this nation will continue undeterred, irrespective of who is working with whom for whatever objective.""
Over the weekend, Kindiki had made remarks alluding to wanting to engage the opposition leader for possible cooperation, something that prompted a strong reaction from Kalonzo.
A report by the Standard also suggested that Kalonzo could be rethinking his political stance—a shift that analysts warned could fracture the opposition’s unity ahead of the 2027 elections.
“This is all diversionary and a poor attempt to divide the United Opposition. I cannot work with or meet up with people with Gen Z blood on their hands, including that of Albert Ojwang. Kenyans know the truth, Mr HalfTam: I will always be on the side of the people,” Kalonzo said in a statement, referencing the recent death of Ojwang inside Nairobi's Central Police Station.

How Ruto Blocked Gachagua's Wife From Attending Official Events,Ruto Block Gachua from Official Events,"Former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has revealed past protocol frustrations under President William Ruto's government, which ultimately compelled him to stand up for his wife, Pastor Dorcas Rigathi.
Gachagua spoke during a church service in Kirinyaga County on Sunday, June 15, where he alleged State House handlers used to enforce discriminatory protocol policies that barred his wife from accompanying him to official functions.
According to Gachagua, the president and his team grew uncomfortable whenever Gachagua was in the company of his wife, yet the president's wife, Mama Rachel Ruto, was absent.
“These people persecuted me and my wife when I was in office,” Gachagua told the congregation. “Because the president did not want me to be with my wife when he was not with his, due to protocol.”

The former DP also claimed that for two years during his tenure, he was restricted from walking or appearing publicly with his spouse. He alleged that on multiple instances, Pastor Dorcas was asked to leave official events, particularly when the first lady was absent.
Gachagua cited one instance during a high-profile government event to unveil Raila Odinga's African Union Commission bid, where the First Lady's absence prompted organisers to ask Pastor Dorcas to leave as well.
“I said no. Why did they call her then? I told them to tell the President that my wife is not leaving,” Gachagua recalled. “If Mama Ida [Raila’s wife] leaves, my wife will leave. And I told him if she goes, I will also go.”
The former DP narrated that his wife was ultimately allowed to remain at the event, and she got the opportunity to pray for Raila.
Gachagua's narration was a direct response to Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi, who had earlier questioned his increased public appearances with his wife, which the lawmaker termed unnecessary.
The former number two, however, stood his ground, saying his commitment to family values is non-negotiable.
“This is personal. I walk with my wife by choice. Not everything is about politics,” he added. 
During the same church service, Gachagua also commented on the current state of the opposition, dismissing the Kenya Kwanza government's calls for Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka to join them.

former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has revealed past protocol frustrations under President William Ruto's government, ultimately forcing him to stand up for his wife, Pastor Dorcas Rigathi. On Sunday, June 15, Rigagua, who had previously stepped down as First Lady of the Kenya Kwanza government after her husband was killed in a coup, spoke during a church service in Kirinyaga County.  

During the service in Mombasa, rigagua recounted how his wife, Mama Rachel Ruto, became a target due to protocol policies that made him uncomfortable when she was present with him at official events. ""The president and his team,"" he said, ""grew weary whenever Rigagua was in the company of her husband.""  

However, Rigagua's wife, Mama Ida Raila, remained unharmed, though she mentioned being called away during a high-profile event to unveil Raila Odinga's African Union Commission bid. ""I told them to tell the president that my wife isn't leaving,"" Rigagua recalled. ""If she leaves, she'll too.""  

 rigagua added that his wife was ultimately allowed to attend the event despite her husband's absence, expressing his commitment to family values as a personal matter rather than about politics.  

The former number two also countered by dismissing calls for Kalonzo Musyoka to join the Kenya Kwanza government, which he called unnecessary and disrespectful. In another church service on March 24 in Tigania West, rigagua addressed public attendees at St. Nicholas Rehabilitation Centre.  

These accounts highlight how protocol issues have strained Ruto's relationship with his wife, who has since faced numerous disciplinary actions within the Kenyan government.","Roto kwa Rulo na ikosanja kwa rigagua during Mombasa mbi June 15.

Ruto Sacks Road Contractor,"Ruto Serves as a Substitute for Road contractors, steps back on them, seeking new opportunities.","President William Ruto on Sunday, June 15, left a congregation stunned after openly dismissing a road contractor for incompetence.
The president spoke during a church service in Kivaywa, where he issued a declaration about the government's frustration over delayed infrastructure projects. While citing one specific road in Butere, Ruto revealed he had sacked a contractor over prolonged delays.
President William Ruto has publicly dismissed a contractor working on a road project in Butere, Kakamega County, citing a lack of progress and warning that non-performing contractors will no longer be tolerated.
“There is a road that has posed a challenge, but I will look for another contractor. I have told the one in place to go look for another job,” said Ruto.

“I have told him to leave the job and go burn charcoal. Let us look for someone else.”
The president's move was met with applause from the crowd, as he promised to oversee road projects in the Western region with more reliable contractors.
He added, “For the rest of the stalled road, we have already paid contractors. They should finish these roads because it will ease transport and grow the Kakamega economy.”
The Head of State further revealed that his administration would launch six new road projects in Kakamega, reaffirming his government's commitment to improving infrastructure in the western region.
On rural electrification, Ruto admitted delays but said affirmative action had been taken to ramp up connections in Western Kenya. According to the president, there was an allocation of Ksh3 billion for the rural electrification program targeting 85,000 households.
“I know that on power, we have lagged behind. That is why I have taken affirmative action. From June 15, the work begins. I have told them that by December, over 35,000 houses should be connected to electricity so we can focus on the next phase next year,"" Ruto added.
Beyond Kakamega, Ruto also disclosed that he had dispatched Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi to China to represent him in high-level talks that could unlock major trade and infrastructure deals for Kenya.
Mudavadi is also expected to lobby for funding towards the construction of the Rironi–Mau Summit–Eldoret–Bungoma–Malaba highway. Ruto noted that due to limited resources, the highway may be built in phases rather than as a single rollout.
The construction process is set to begin in August. Meanwhile, the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) plans to invest billions of Kenyans' savings into constructing the Nairobi–Rironi–Mau Summit Highway if its joint bid with the China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) is successful.
Ruto's dismissal of a contractor was in a similar fashion to that of Nakuru Governor Susan Kihika, who dismissed her speechwriter for making an error in her Madaraka Day speech.
While delivering her speech on Sunday, June 1, a hilarious moment erupted as the governor was outlining the ongoing projects in the county after she mistakenly referred to the Wanyororo Vocational Training Centre in Kabatini as the now-famous 'Wamunyoro', the home of the former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua.

Kenya Police Wins First-Ever Premier League Title,Kenya Police Frustration Free Championship Title,"Kenya Police secured their maiden title convincingly after a narrow 1-0 victory over Shabana FC on Sunday, June 15, to break the dominance of Gor Mahia and Tusker FC.
Brian Okoth scored the only goal of the game as his second-half header gave the 11-year-old club a victory in a game that had very little pressure.
Going into the final game of the season, Kenya Police only needed a solitary point to clinch their first-ever Kenya Premier League crown at the expense of familiar contenders Gor Mahia, who are the most successful club in the competition's history.
Shabana, infamous for their overzealous fans, had an outside chance of clinching the title going into the final weeks of the season, but they eventually fell off in the race and were heading against Police FC solely looking to spoil the party.

For Gor Mahia, they will be kicking themselves at what is possibly a missed opportunity, thanks to a couple of dropped points in recent weeks. Many pundits have argued that the 1-1 draw against AFC Leopards on June 2 in Homa Bay sealed their fate.
K'Ogalo secured a 3-2 win over Ulinzi Stars on Sunday, but it was too little, too late, as Kenya Police had done just enough to get over the line. 
Dig Deeper: Kenya Police's victory in the Premier League is commendable for a number of reasons. Founded in 2014, the team has been on a steady ascent to the top.
Nicknamed 'Makarao,' they achieved promotion to the top tier in 2021, and at the time, some critics saw them as flukes who would easily get relegated again.
However, their debut Premier League campaign culminated in an impressive third-place finish in 2023–24, and the Kenya Police Service-owned club effectively stamped their mark as a team that was in the top tier to stay.
In the same season, Kenya Police also won the FKF President’s Cup for the first time, which earned them a place in the 2024–25 CAF Confederation Cup.
November 2024 proved to be a turning point for the Kenya Police after the appointment of Burundian coach Etienne Ndayiragije, who was a key factor in the team's success this season.
Following their victory, the Kenya Police are set to bag several accolades, including a Ksh5 million prize and the coveted trophy.
In addition, the Law Enforcers are also set to feature in the most prestigious club competition in Africa—the CAF Champions League, which brings together the top club teams from across the continent, who qualify by performing well in their national leagues.

"Ruto Reveals Why He Sent Mudavadi to China, Months After Visit",Ruto Reveals His Secret: He Sent Mudavadi To China After Spending Several Months Visiting,"President William Ruto has dispatched Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi to China to represent him in high-level talks that could unlock major trade and infrastructure deals for Kenya.
Speaking during a church service at Friends Comprehensive School in Kivaywa in Kakamega County, Ruto said the trip is aimed at securing financing for key national projects, including the extension of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to Malaba.
Mudavadi is also expected to lobby for funding towards the construction of the Rironi–Mau Summit–Eldoret–Bungoma–Malaba highway. Ruto noted that due to limited resources, the highway may be built in phases rather than as a single rollout.
The construction process is set to begin in August. Meanwhile, the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) plans to invest billions of Kenyans' savings into constructing the Nairobi–Rironi–Mau Summit Highway if its joint bid with the China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) is successful.

The planned construction of the road, expected to ease congestion and enhance trade and travel between Kenya and its neighbours in the west, comes amid public concerns over the use of pension funds for infrastructure development.
At the heart of the China visit is also a push for a new trade agreement, as Kenya continues to await the outcome of potential negotiations with the US on the future of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).
""You know that we are now producing on a large scale avocados, tea, coffee, and macadamia. All that needs a market, and we have been signing agreements among them with the UK, the US, and now we have one with China,"" Ruto announced.  
""Musalia and his team are working on the Chinese market, and we hope that in the next three or four months we will be able to conclude that so that our products can have access to a larger market,"" he added. 
President Ruto, who last visited China in April, has faced criticism over his diplomatic balancing act between Beijing and Washington. During his trip, he defended Kenya’s cooperation with China amid growing pressure from the United States, which has increasingly scrutinised the nature of Chinese investments in Africa.
While China remains a key trading partner for the US, it is also viewed as a strategic rival. The two global superpowers have clashed over trade practices, with Washington accusing Beijing of unfair economic tactics—tensions that have complicated diplomatic relations for countries like Kenya seeking to engage both sides.
The Head of State said Kenya's cooperation with China is mainly in the spirit of multilateralism. In an interview with the China Global Television Network (CGTN), he stated that multilateralism, a system where multiple countries collaborate to achieve common goals, was key to achieving fairer trade.
The latest comes after US Senator and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Jim Risch raised concerns over Kenya’s growing ties with China, calling for a reassessment of the relationship between Kenya and the US.
Responding to Ruto's April visit to Beijing, Senator Risch warned that Kenya’s deepening partnership with China signals more than just an economic partnership and could indicate a shift in global allegiances.
Speaking during a Senate hearing on East Africa and the Horn of Africa on Tuesday, May 13, Risch pointed to Ruto’s remarks where he declared that Kenya and China are “co-architects of a new world order.”
According to the Senator, such comments reflect a high level of alignment with China that should prompt the US to reconsider its engagement with Kenya.
“Just last month, President Ruto declared that Kenya, a major non-NATO ally, and China are co-architects of a new world order.” That’s not just alignment to China; it’s allegiance,” the statement read in part.
During his China trip, Ruto signed deals amounting to Ksh100 billion spanning across several areas of development in Kenya’s economy.

PCS","President William Ruto has dispatched Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi to China post-visit months after the April visit in March 2025. During a church service in Kakamega County, Kenya, Ruto highlighted the trip's aim to secure financing for key national projects, including the extension of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to Malaba and support for infrastructure development through the construction of the Rironi–Mau Summit–Eldoret–Bungoma–Malaba highway. The project is expected to be built in phases due to limited resources. Ruto also expressed hope that a joint bid with China's Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) would secure funding for infrastructure development, which could range from billions of Kenyan savings.

Ruto criticized the diplomatic balance between Kenya and Beijing, particularly amid concerns over the use of pension funds in Africa. He emphasized the importance of fostering new trade agreements and supporting Kenya's alignment with China as a key partner. While China remains a strategic rival, the US accuses Beijing of unfair economic practices. Ruto's remarks at the US Senate hearing on East Africa highlighted Kenya's deepening partnership with China, signaling a shift in global allegiances.

Ruto made significant investments worth Ksh100 billion across development sectors in Kenya during the visit to Beijing in March 2025, including the Standard Gauge Railway and infrastructure projects. His remarks at the US Senate hearing on East Africa underscore his alignment with China's interests, urging the US to reconsider its engagement with Kenya.

How Police Caught Woman Smuggling Ksh4M Worth of Cocaine at JKIA,How Police Caught a Woman Smuggling Ksh 4 million Worth of Cocaine at JKIA,"Detectives on Friday arrested a 26-year-old Kenyan woman who attempted to smuggle cocaine through Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) by ingesting drug pellets.
According to a police report, the suspect—whose confidence seemingly outweighed her carry-on luggage—was intercepted by hawk-eyed officers on June 13, 2025, at around 10am, just minutes before boarding an outbound flight. Her uneasy demeanour during a routine screening raised suspicion, prompting further checks.
She was subjected to a thorough search, after which officers suspected she had concealed foreign substances internally. She was immediately placed under medical observation.
The detectives, in coordination with other government units at the airport, embarked on a medical response to make her release the swallowed narcotics.

Later that day, the woman requested to use the washroom, where she excreted two pellets. By the following day, June 14, she had passed six more, bringing the total to eight cocaine-filled pellets. 
""The woman, whose confidence was clearly larger than her carry-on luggage, was intercepted by hawk-eyed detectives on June 13, 2025, at around 10 am, just minutes before boarding an outbound flight. Her uneasy demeanour during a routine screening set off alarm bells,"" the DCI shared in a report.
''Following this, she was subjected to a thorough search. It was soon established that she had concealed foreign substances inside her body cavity, prompting immediate medical observation.''
The recovered pellets contained cocaine weighing approximately 626.65 grams, which, according to the current market value, could cost approximately Ksh4.39 million. 
JKIA’s Anti-Narcotics Unit has since launched preparations to arraign her in court on Monday following the completion of investigations. 
In a related incident, detectives arrested a United States citizen who ingested several pellets of cocaine in a bid to traffic them from Alabama to Saudi Arabia on February 19 this year. 
According to the detectives, the suspected trafficker was nabbed after a tip-off from a doctor at a hospital in Nairobi. Moments after being admitted, the doctor promptly alerted anti-narcotics detectives from DCI Headquarters, who visited the facility to witness an endoscopy process on the suspect.
During the process, three pellets were recovered from the suspect's rectum, which turned out to be cocaine weighing 57.98 grams. The DCI officers took the pellets and documented the incident.

Governor Implicated in Abduction & Torture of Top County Official,Governor Imprisoned in Abduction & Torture of Top Official,"Vocal Africa CEO Hussein Khalid has opened the lid on an unsolved abduction case involving a former county official of a county in the northeastern region.
In a statement on Sunday, June 15, Khalid revealed that the former Chief Officer for Health in the county had recently been abducted and tortured, allegedly by the county governor, whom, due to legal reasons, we opt not to name at this time. 
Despite efforts to get justice for him, however, Khalid relayed that the relevant authorities had yet to make any arrests, although the evidence in the case is reportedly overwhelming.
""At Vocal Africa, we are presently following up on a matter where a former Chief Officer (Health) was abducted, apparently by the Governor of the same County and tortured,"" Khalid stated.

Although he did not provide more details on the matter, he stated that the evidence presented to police officers included clear CCTV footage implicating the governor.
Therefore, Khalid called for the intervention of the Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA) and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) to quickly resolve the matter.
""The matter has been reported at various police stations, yet no action has been taken despite the abductors being known and all evidence, including CCTV footage, being shared. We demand immediate action by IPOA and DCI to end impunity in the country.""
According to the human rights group in the county that is nested around six others, including Meru, Laikipia, Samburu, Marsabit, Garissa, and Wajir counties, residents and leaders are living in fear over incidents that have been termed as intimidation tactics.
Accompanying the statement were two images of the former county official, fresh from the hospital, with the drip still intact. The Members of the County Assembly have also claimed that their lives may be in danger since they filed a motion seeking to impeach the governor.
Reportedly, they have all switched off their phones and gone into hiding since filing the motion last Tuesday.
This report comes at a volatile time in the country, where cases of forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings have left Kenyans on edge.
Over the past week, activists and politicians have been calling for justice in the death of teacher-cum-blogger Albert Ojwang, who passed away in police custody after being arrested in Homa Bay and driven over 350km to Nairobi last weekend.
What followed later was an outpouring of love for Ojwang's father as Kenyans called for top officials in the government to be held accountable over the same.
The Deputy Inspector General of the Kenya Police Service, Eliud Lagat, who was the complainant in the case that landed Ojwang in police custody, is among the top officials being urged to resign by a section of Kenyans.
DCI boss Mohammed Amin and the Inspector General of Police, Douglas Kanja, are also facing backlash for reportedly peddling lies during the probe of the case at the Senate and the National Assembly.

On June 15, Khalid revealed that the former Chief Officer for Health was last week abducted and tortured, with the case reportedly having overwhelming evidence against him.

Despite efforts to secure justice, Khalid emphasized that authorities have yet to arrest anyone but have provided clear CCTV footage implicating the governor. In a meeting with President William Ruto on June 4, the county government highlighted the gravity of the matter: “Governors are being forced into this situation without a fair trial. We urge independent authorities to take action and ensure justice is served.” The Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA) and the Department of Criminal Investigations (DCI) have been directed to act swiftly.

The county’s Assembly members also raised concerns, claiming their safety may be at risk due to a motion seeking to impeach the governor. Two images of the former health chief were shared during the press conference, with both the chief and Assembly members claiming they switched off their phones and went into hiding after filing the motion on Tuesday.

The report comes at a time of heightened tensions in Kenya, where cases of forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings have left many Kenyan lives in danger. Activists and politicians are urging justice for teacher-cum-blogger Albert Ojwang, who passed away in police custody after being arrested in Homa Bay last weekend and transported more than 350km to Nairobi.

The probe into Ojwang’s case was reportedly marked by peddling of lies during the Senate and National Assembly investigations.

Govt Gives Notice to Coastal Landowners,Government has introduced a notice to alert coastal landowners.,"The government has announced intentions to acquire land from property owners at the coast for the construction of multimillion-dollar road projects that are set to ease congestion and improve mobility over the region. 
The National Land Commission (NLC), on behalf of the Kenya Ports Authority, in a gazette notice, announced that the government had intended to acquire a total of 12.15 acres from seven landowners to pave the way for the project. 
The Mombasa Port Area Road Development Project (MPARDP)—which includes the Mombasa Bypass and the Kipevu New Container Terminal (KNTC) Link Road—is a strategic infrastructure project aimed at improving road connectivity and easing congestion around the Port of Mombasa.
''In pursuance of the Land Act, No. 6 of 2012, Part VIII, the National Land Commission, on behalf of Kenya Ports Authority (KPA), gives notice that the National Government intends to acquire the parcels of land listed below for the Mombasa Port Area Road Development Project in Mombasa County,"" NLC's notice read in part. 
Mombasa Port managed by the Kenya Ports Authority FACEBOOK
The project, which comprises the Mombasa Southern Bypass and the Kipevu New Container Terminal (KNTC) Link Road, is expected to improve the movement of cargo in and out of the port. It is part of efforts to streamline logistics by linking the port with key transport corridors, including the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) and the Northern Corridor.
According to officials, the Kipevu Link Road will enable direct access to the new container terminal, reducing delays caused by traffic jams in Mombasa’s CBD and around the port. 
The road will also connect to the Dongo Kundu Bypass, offering a direct route to the South Coast without relying on the Likoni Ferry.
The project is a key component of Kenya’s Vision 2030 and is jointly funded by the government and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). It is being implemented by the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA).
Meanwhile, NLC announced another fresh round of public inquiries into land earmarked for compulsory acquisition to pave the way for the Mombasa Port Area Road Development Project. 
The inquiries, scheduled for July 1, 2025, will be held at the Likoni Chief’s Office from 9am to 4pm and will involve several parcels within the Mombasa South/Block I area.
Among the affected properties is land owned by the KPA, which will be acquired for the construction of critical road links, including the Kipevu New Container Terminal Link Road. The exercise is being conducted on behalf of the KeNHA. 
In recent years, the government has completed key road and port infrastructure projects in the region. Notably, the Dongo Kundu Bypass, also known as the Mombasa Southern Bypass, was completed in phases and now provides an alternative route for traffic heading to the South Coast, bypassing the often-congested Likoni Ferry. 
The project includes a bridge over the Mwache Creek and has opened up new industrial zones around Miritini and Dongo Kundu.
Additionally, the Kipevu Oil Terminal II was commissioned to expand the port’s fuel handling capacity. The terminal, built by China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), has reduced ship waiting times and improved the efficiency of oil imports.
