Medics Throw Fresh Headache to Govt,"The Kenya National Union of Medical Laboratory Officers (KNUNMLO) has strongly opposed the newly proposed Quality Healthcare and Patient Safety Bill.
According to the Public Health Principal Secretary, Mary Muthoni, in a statement on Sunday, June 8, the bill, which is open for public participation between June 23 to 27, will ensure that healthcare facilities across the country maintain the highest medical standards while offering services to patients.
If the bill sails through and becomes law, healthcare providers who are caught mismanaging patients will be subjected to fines of up to Ksh50 million and jail terms of up to 10 years.
Additionally, all private and government-owned facilities will be required to adhere to set standards, which include maintaining proper sanitation, lighting, ventilation, water and food safety, enforcing anti-abuse policies, and providing adequate patient nutrition.

The bill also proposes the erection of a Quality Healthcare and Patient Safety Authority, which will take over the role of registering, licensing, and accrediting health facilities, overseeing their operations nationwide.
However, in a statement on  Monday, June 17, the Union claims that the bill will compromise professional independence, patient safety, and the integrity of the country's healthcare system.
According to KNUMLO, the government aims to centralise the regulation of the country's healthcare system, which will, as a result, bring the country's healthcare under political and commercial control.
According to the medics, the bill is a plot by cartels to privately control the Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF), which they claim has deepened their influence at the Ministry of Health.
""This Bill is not about reform—it is about control and money. It aims to hijack the Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF) and shift regulatory authority to politically connected actors for private gain,"" the statement read.
""Even more disturbing is the secrecy around this Bill. Its authors remain hidden while clearly working to dismantle professional regulation and remove public oversight,"" it added. 
Additionally, the Union claimed that creating a new authority to take over the mandate of registering and licensing healthcare facilities would undermine the role of the Kenya Accreditation Service (KENAS), which is currently responsible for accrediting health facilities in the country.
""We are deeply concerned about the growing influence of cartels in the Ministry of Health, who appear to have captured Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale,"" it stated.

How Govt Intends to Use Ksh4 Billion in Ruto's New Project,"The government, through the Ministry of Agriculture, will be investing Ksh4 billion through the Sugar Development Levy (SDL) to support the sugar industry.
This announcement was made by the Agriculture Cabinet Secretary, Mutahi Kagwe, when he visited the West Kenya Sugar Company on Monday, June 16, just weeks after the company took over the control of the Nzoia Sugar Company.
In a contentious takeover, the group signed a 30-year lease with the government in a move expected to revive the state-owned mill and bring stability to the sector.
While unveiling the fund, CS Kagwe stated that it was intended to support sustainable growth across the entire sugar industry, not just a single player.

“These investments are designed to secure the long-term sustainability of the sugar industry,” CS Kagwe said.
Of the Ksh4 billion annual investment plan, 40 per cent, which is about Ksh2 billion, will be utilised in cane development programs across the country. 
The rest, 60 per cent will go towards the development of other strategic sectors meant to grow the sugar industry positively.
For instance, 15 per cent—about Ksh600 million—will be used in the rehabilitation of roads in sugarcane-growing regions.
Another Ksh600 million will go to research and innovation for improved industry productivity, and yet another one to factory rehabilitation across the sector.
5 per cent of the fund, which is around Ksh200 million, will be utilised to strengthen farmer associations, and the last 10 per cent will go to administrative operations under the Sugar Board.
During the visit, the CS further commended West Kenya Sugar for implementing policies that favour farmers, including weekly payments to over 120,000 contracted farmers. 
He also highlighted the company disburses over Ksh14 billion annually in farmer payments and invests an additional Ksh7 billion annually in cane development initiatives.
The Rai Sugar Group, which manages the company, reportedly manages nearly 50 per cent of the land under sugarcane cultivation in Kenya.

IMF Sends Officials to Kenya Amid Fresh Protests,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is set to survey the impact of corruption on public finances in the country over the next two weeks in a bid to pave the way for a new financial support agreement.
According to reports from Bloomberg, the team from the IMF will scrutinise the effectiveness of Kenya's anti-corruption legal and institutional framework, in addition to examining graft risks in fiscal and central bank governance, the rule of law, and market regulations.
According to an IMF spokesperson, the 14-day study will be foundational in enabling the government to reinforce its anti-corruption capacity before it enters into a new funding agreement with the lender.
The planned engagement with the IMF reflects Kenya’s search for new financing in a bid to stabilise to stimulate economic growth, a factor that has recurrently triggered protests in the country.

""The review is part of the IMF’s commitment to helping strengthen governance and anti-corruption frameworks,” an IMF spokesperson told the publication.
According to Bloomberg, the team will then relay the findings of their study to the Kenyan government and publish thereafter after a green light from the state.
In March 2025, Kenya decided not to proceed with the 9th review, foregoing an estimated $800 million disbursement, to open talks for a new funding arrangement.
 The IMF’s Executive Board completed the 7th and 8th reviews of Kenya’s $3.6 bn Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and Extended Credit Facility (ECF), along with a Resilience & Sustainability Facility (RSF), unlocking around $606 million in new funding.
In May 2025, an IMF staff-level agreement was reached for a Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) loan worth Ksh75.3 billion. This funding is conditional on climate and green reforms and is expected to be disbursed in early November.
Speaking on Wednesday, June 11, the CBK Governor Kamau Thugge confirmed that the country had penned a letter to the IMF requesting to negotiate a new arrangement.
“We are indeed having discussions with the IMF, and the government did send a letter to the IMF requesting to negotiate a new arrangement. We are expecting an IMF team to come in September to start discussions on the Article IV consultation,” the Governor said.
According to Thugge, the team conducts an in-depth assessment of the country's economic and financial policies and a debt sustainability analysis.

Kenya Clarifies Sending Weapons to Sudan After NTV Exposé,"Kenya has denied sending arms used in the hostilities in the neighbouring Sudan, distancing itself from allegations raised in a recent exposé by NTV.
Government Spokesperson Isaac Mwaura dismissed claims that Kenya supplied illicit weapons to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), stating that the country’s role in Sudan is strictly limited to humanitarian assistance and support for peace processes. “Kenya is supporting the peace process through IGAD. Any other assertion is mere conjecture. We have no business with the claims being made out there,” he said.
Mwaura, speaking during a press briefing in Nairobi, further stated that Kenya, like any sovereign nation, is free to engage in legitimate trade partnerships, adding that the allegations being circulated have no factual basis.
He revealed that the government had donated Ksh256 million (approximately USD 2 million) to aid Sudan’s ongoing peace initiatives and support humanitarian interventions for civilians affected by the conflict.

Reaffirming Kenya’s neutral stance, Mwaura emphasised that the country remains non-aligned and is willing to host both the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and the RSF to facilitate peace talks.
He also called for a harmonised peace framework involving the African Union and United Nations, similar to the Ushirika model adopted in South Sudan.
The allegations against Kenya emerged from a joint investigation by NTV and open-source intelligence platform Bellingcat, which revealed images of Kenyan-labelled ammunition crates allegedly found in a captured RSF depot near Sudan’s capital, Khartoum.
While the contents of every crate could not be independently verified, nearby ammunition matching the labels indicating arms either bought or sent to Kenya for the Ministry of Defence, was displayed by the Sudanese Armed Forces in the now viral videos.
In response, the Ministry of Defence denied any connection to the weapons saying it could not identify the crates. “Upon examination of the photographs provided, we wish to state that we do not recognise the crates nor the inscriptions on them,” the ministry to Nation.
According to the probe by the two institutions, the ministry appeared to address only domestically manufactured arms and did not clarify whether Kenya had made any weapons imports, exports, or transfers that might explain the presence of the crates in Sudan, leaving critical questions about the alleged link unanswered.
On March 14, the government of Sudan suspended all imports from Kenya following the latter's decision to host the RSF, a rebel group currently fighting the Sudanese army for control of the country.
Sudan announced the immediate restriction of all imports from Kenya, barring entry via ports, railways, and air transport.
""The import of all products from Kenya via all ports, crossings, airports, and entry points is suspended starting from this date until further notice,"" read part of the letter by Sudan's Acting Minister of Trade and Supplies, Omar Ahmed Mohamed Ali.
The Acting Minister stated that the decision was due to Kenya's defiant act of hosting and sponsoring the rebel group in Nairobi, adding that the move was aimed at protecting Sudan’s national interests and security.

Why You Could Soon be Arrested for Selling to Street Families,"Nairobi County Chief Environment Officer Geoffrey Mosiria has announced that his department will soon begin cracking down on vendors selling jet fuel and other harmful substances to street families.
In a statement on Sunday night, Mosiria relayed that this was in a bid to clear street families out of the Nairobi central business district (CBD).
""We have also begun raids on those selling jet fuel and other harmful substances to street families,"" he stated during a routine CBD inspection.
He added that he would be collaborating with the National Authority for the Campaign Against Drug Abuse (NACADA) for enforcement in eradicating the rampant use of drugs and other harmful substances among street families.

As such, he urged good Samaritans willing to help these families to desist from giving them cash but buy them essentials like food instead. This, he said, could also deter fake beggars who pose as street families to attract empathy from do-gooders.
""We have started an operation to remove street families from our streets because some pretend to be homeless and beg for money. When offered support to go home, to rehabilitation centres, or shelters, they often refuse, being used to free cash on the streets,"" he stated.
""I urge anyone who wants to help not to give cash but to buy food and encourage them to return home or connect them with homes for the homeless. Giving money only fuels drug peddlers who sell substances to these vulnerable people in the CBD.""
Mosiria was speaking after rescuing a street family member from an angry mob after he was caught attempting to steal recently installed bins in the CBD.
Other street families present during the altercation also expressed anger at the man, stating that his theft could have the families booted from the streets.
This move is the latest by the chief officer, who, during a recent CBD patrol, came across a mother with a young child claiming they had been abandoned by the child's mother, an assertion that turned out to be a ruse.
After paying for the woman's fare back home upcountry, the woman reportedly split the amount with the driver and refused to partake in the journey.
This revelation has now fuelled Mosiria's latest mission to drive fake homeless people from the streets who, especially, exploit children in a bid to attract empathy from unwitting Kenyans and get free money from them.

Wajackoyah's Plan to Stop DIG Lagat From Fleeing Kenya,"Former presidential aspirant George Wajackoyah has vowed to petition the international community to impose a travel ban on Deputy Inspector General of Police Eliud Lagat over what he termed as interference and the mishandling of investigations into the death of blogger Albert Ojwang.
Speaking during a live interview on NTV on Monday, Wajackoyah—a lawyer with practices in both Kenya and the UK — said he would leverage his international legal networks to lobby the European Union and US lawmakers to restrict Lagat and his family from travelling abroad unless he steps aside.
“I will personally contact the EU. I practice law in the UK and the EU. I will write to US congressmen to ensure this man does not leave the country unless he steps down,” said Wajackoyah.
When questioned why he would not allow Kenya’s legal institutions to handle the matter, Wajackoyah, a former police officer, dismissed the local justice system as compromised and incapable of delivering justice for Ojwang’s family.
A photo of Albert Ojwang, who passed away under unclear circumstances on Sunday, June 8 2025. PHOTO ALBERT OJWANG.
“The criminal justice system in this country does not work—has never worked, and will never work. We are turning to the West because that is the only way justice can be served, unless we borrow a leaf from Burkina Faso,” he declared.
He further criticised the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) for what he termed a lukewarm response to the case and demanded the resignation of both DIG Lagat and Interior CS Kipchumba Murkomen, accusing them of inaction and failing to uphold accountability.
However, Wajackoyah sought to absolve the Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja, from the mess, maintaining that he had nothing to do with the mess at the Central Police Station and the circumstances surrounding the demise of Ojwang. 
Further, Wajackoyah took a swipe at the Kenya Kwanza administration, accusing President William Ruto’s government of inefficiency and poor leadership. He argued that many individuals appointed to critical positions lacked the moral authority and integrity required to serve Kenyans effectively.
Recalling his days as a police officer stationed at the Central Police Station, Wajackoyah claimed he could detect insincerity from experience and intuition, alleging that Lagat’s conduct—including his body language during recent public briefings—betrayed a deeper truth about the case. “I can read these things spiritually,” he remarked, insisting that the DIG, as an implicated party, cannot be trusted to oversee a credible investigation and should therefore step aside.
''I have been a police officer for so many years. I first started at Central Police Station as a police constable at the cell sentry. So I understand the dynamics in that station very well. The most dynamic thing here is that an accuser cannot become the judge, in this case, the DIG. He should have stepped aside,"" he added. 
On Monday 9, Kanja confirmed that the late influencer, who died while in police custody, was under investigation for allegedly defaming DIG Lagat.
Responding to questions from journalists during a press briefing at Central Police Station in Nairobi, Kanja revealed that the DIG had lodged a formal complaint against Ojwang, prompting his arrest and subsequent questioning.
On Wednesday last week, the police boss revealed details of the alleged posts that DIG Lagat had reported. He stated that the account, which had over 13,000 followers, had allegedly published false information accusing the DIG of involvement in corruption within the NPS.

Another Man Dies While in Police Custody,"Police in Homa Bay County have launched investigations into the death of a 36-year-old man under mysterious circumstances while in custody at Kipasi Police Post in Mbita.
The man, identified as Calvince Omondi Onditi, reportedly died by suicide on the morning of Sunday, June 15, just hours after his arrest around midnight. 
Police allege that he used his trousers to hang himself inside a holding room. Omondi, a fisherman at Ndhuru Beach, had allegedly been found trespassing in a goat pen before being apprehended by police after the area chief was alerted.
However, locals, family members, and leaders—including Suba North MP Millie Odhiambo—have disputed the police version of events, calling for a thorough probe.

Odhiambo, visibly angered, dismissed the suicide claims as unconvincing, likening the case to that of Albert Ojwang, another Homa Bay resident who died in suspicious circumstances after being picked up by police.
“These deaths in police cells cannot go on. Albert Ojwang’s case is still unresolved, and now they’ve killed Mr. Onditi in my constituency. Yet again, they’re pushing this stupid suicide narrative,” she stated.
“We were called and told that your brother is dead, and we were left in shock. How could this happen? You informed us he was taken to Mbita just hours earlier, and then this is what we find. When we arrived there, we found him hanging,” added a family member of Omondi.
A post-mortem examination is expected to be conducted at Homa Bay Teaching and Referral Hospital to determine the actual cause of death. At the hospital, Chief Executive Officer Vincent Oduor confirmed that Calvin’s body showed signs of injury.
“We expect that an autopsy will be conducted on the body, but just from an initial overview, we have observed strangulation marks on the neck. The noose, made from long trousers, is still intact, and the tongue is also bitten. So far, there are no other significant marks on the body apart from these,” Oduor stated.
Meanwhile, three civilians who had been detained at the Central Police Station, Nairobi, on the night of Ojwang's death have been arrested in connection with the case.
According to the Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA), the three were instructed by police officers at the station to torture Ojwang to death while in custody.
Although the reasons for their initial arrests have not been made public yet, they are said to have been released shortly after the influencer's death. Following IPOA's probe, they were re-arrested on Sunday and are currently being held separately at Kilimani, Muthangari, and Kileleshwa Police Stations.

Matatu Ferrying Students Overturns Along Thika Road,"A 14-seater matatu ferrying school children overturned on Thika Road near Garden City in Nairobi on Monday morning, sparking panic among motorists during the morning rush hour.
The vehicle, which was reportedly speeding, lost control and landed on its roof, prompting swift rescue efforts from passersby and first responders. 
The matatu, painted in very bright pink, is said to have been travelling towards the TRM Mall direction when the accident occurred.
Videos and images obtained by Kenyans.co.ke showed the children safely seated by the roadside within the inner lane, though it remains unclear whether any of them sustained major injuries.

The accident occurred during the morning peak hours, and the injured students were rushed to the hospital for medical attention.
The crash triggered a heavy traffic snarl-up along Thika Road as police officers, local authorities, and boda boda riders coordinated rescue operations and worked to clear the wreckage.
The traffic jam stretched from Githurai 45 to the accident scene near Garden City Mall, affecting both lanes heading towards Nairobi’s central business district.
Notably, the van lacked the mandatory yellow paint required for vehicles transporting school children. Instead, it was painted pink—a violation that has reignited concerns over lax enforcement of transport safety regulations for school vehicles operating on major highways.
The National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) set strict guidelines for school transport vehicles to enhance the safety of learners on Kenyan roads. Among the key requirements is that all school buses must be painted in a distinct yellow colour (code FFD800) and clearly labelled “School Bus” on the front and rear.
In addition to the paint, the NTSA requires all such vehicles to be fitted with flashing red lights, a stop-signal arm, functional seatbelts, and a visible complaints hotline for the public to report reckless driving. Buses must also carry the phrase “DO NOT PASS WHEN RED LIGHTS ARE FLASHING” in bold letters at the rear.
The rules, part of NTSA’s broader school transport safety framework, are meant to ensure better visibility of school buses and standardise safety protocols across the country. The agency has warned of penalties for non-compliance, including fines, impounding of vehicles, and possible suspension of operating licences.
Between January and March 2025, Kenya recorded 1,139 road accident fatalities, according to data from the NTSA — a slight drop compared to the 1,166 deaths reported over the same period in 2024.

Babu Owino Claps Back at Nelson Amenya in Online Spat,"Embakasi East Member of Parliament Babu Owino has slammed Adani whistleblower Nelson Amenya over his remarks that he was lacking in legislative duties.
In a statement on Sunday, June 16, the MP highlighted four bills that he has sponsored and supported in Parliament despite Amenya claiming that he had not sponsored any visionary legislation.
According to the MP, he has sponsored the Legal Education (Amendment) Bill,2023, the Kenya School of Law (amendment) Bill,2023, the Higher Education Loans Board(amendment) Bill,2020 and supported the Social Workers Bill.
Citing an Infotrack poll in February, the MP also relayed that he had been ranked the best-performing MP countrywide, despite doing it all from the opposition party.

""I was ranked the best-performing MP in Kenya while in opposition. I may not be the best, but there is none better than me so far in the race. The rest are unworthy opponents,"" he stated.
The rift started on Sunday when Amenya disagreed with an X user who urged Nairobi residents to vote for Babu Owino to replace Governor Johnson Sakaja.
According to Amenya, Owino's record as Embakasi East MP was underwhelming, and so was his record in parliament.
For that reason, he asserted that Nairobi did not need ""another populist like Sakaja"" but a competent technocrat who understands systems, not just soundbites.
""Even if we set aside DJ Evolve's case and assess him purely on leadership merit, the record is underwhelming. What visionary legislation has he sponsored in Parliament?"" Amenya quipped.
""Has his constituency seen measurable change in poverty, unemployment, security, and youth engagement? What tangible progress has he delivered in education or healthcare?"" he added.
Although he has yet to declare his intentions for the Nairobi top seat, the MP has emerged as a fan favourite to replace Sakaja in the upcoming 2027 general elections.
He has also repeatedly bashed the Nairobi governor's administration every chance he gets, leaving little to the imagination that he is up to vie for the capital's top seat.

"One Dead, Several Trapped as Another Gold Mine Collapses","One person has been confirmed dead and scores of others are feared trapped after a gold mine collapsed at Kambi Karaya in West Pokot County on Sunday evening.
The incident comes barely a week after a similar tragedy in Karon village, Turkwel, where four people died and five others were injured following another gold mine collapse.
Just days earlier, six miners had also perished in a separate incident in the same region, raising alarm over the rapid rise in illegal mining activities.
Reports indicated that the miners had returned to the site at night using picks and hoes, unaware that the soil had become loose after excavators had dug the pit during the day.

Local authorities, led by the police and emergency response teams, are currently conducting rescue operations amid growing concerns over the frequency and scale of such accidents in West Pokot.
In response, the government has announced fresh measures to curb unregulated mining. The State Department of Mining has established a new county-level office in West Pokot to enhance oversight, licensing, and compliance enforcement.
“Previously, we had regional mining offices. Going forward, we’ve restructured them into county mining offices to better serve the people,” said David Onyancha, a senior mining official.
West Pokot Governor Simon Kachapin echoed the government’s efforts, noting, “As a county, we are setting up frameworks to ensure that our people can safely exploit these minerals. This is a county of hidden treasures—but they must be harnessed safely.”
The National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) on Monday last week halted all mining activities within the Kambi Karai and Lami Nyeusi regions along the River Turkwel in Sigor Constituency.
According to NEMA, the closure was necessitated by the numerous complaints it has been receiving on the illicit mining points along the River Turkwel in Turkana County and West Pokot County. 
Despite the area having over 200 gold mining sites, the sites were found to be operating without Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) licences, leaving deep holes and dirty waters along the river, making it unsuitable for domestic consumption.
""NEMA has today directed mining activities within the Kambi Karai and Lami Nyeusi region along River Turkwel in Sigor Constituency to stop further operations due to their negative environmental impacts,"" NEMA confirmed.

Kindiki Threatens to Tackle Kalonzo Head-On Over Falsehoods,"Deputy President Kithure Kindiki has responded to former Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka over his assertion that he is unwilling to work with the government.
In a statement on Sunday, June 15, the deputy president acknowledged the remarks but did not take kindly to the ""unkind words"" Kalonzo said about him.
On Sunday morning, Kalonzo described Kindiki as ""Mr Half term"", asserting that his invitation to join the ruling alliance was a diversionary tactic meant to destabilise the united opposition coalition.
As such, DP Kindiki stated that he would not engage the former VP in a public battle of words, as that was not his intention, maintaining that he still held the Wiper Party leader in high regard. 
Wiper Party Leader Kalonzo Musyoka addressing journalists, May 27, 2025. PHOTO KALONZO MUSYOKA
""I hear my big brother Kalonzo has said he doesn’t wish to work with me politically. That is fine with me. For the unkind things he has said about me, I won’t answer him back publicly, not because I can’t, but because I never do public duels with people  I respect,"" part of the statement read.
However, he revealed that despite his high regard for Kalonzo, he was not beyond indulging in a head-on confrontation with him if he did not stop spreading lies about him.
Despite the rejection by the opposition, however, he relayed that he would keep pushing the development agenda to work for all Kenyans.
""Nevertheless, if he continues with his falsehoods unprovoked, I will happily tackle him head-on. Respect is a two-way street. For now, Kalonzo will remain the good big brother I have known for decades,"" Kindiki stated.
""Meanwhile, the Government’s development agenda for all the people of this nation will continue undeterred, irrespective of who is working with whom for whatever objective.""
Over the weekend, Kindiki had made remarks alluding to wanting to engage the opposition leader for possible cooperation, something that prompted a strong reaction from Kalonzo.
A report by the Standard also suggested that Kalonzo could be rethinking his political stance—a shift that analysts warned could fracture the opposition’s unity ahead of the 2027 elections.
“This is all diversionary and a poor attempt to divide the United Opposition. I cannot work with or meet up with people with Gen Z blood on their hands, including that of Albert Ojwang. Kenyans know the truth, Mr HalfTam: I will always be on the side of the people,” Kalonzo said in a statement, referencing the recent death of Ojwang inside Nairobi's Central Police Station.

How Ruto Blocked Gachagua's Wife From Attending Official Events,"Former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has revealed past protocol frustrations under President William Ruto's government, which ultimately compelled him to stand up for his wife, Pastor Dorcas Rigathi.
Gachagua spoke during a church service in Kirinyaga County on Sunday, June 15, where he alleged State House handlers used to enforce discriminatory protocol policies that barred his wife from accompanying him to official functions.
According to Gachagua, the president and his team grew uncomfortable whenever Gachagua was in the company of his wife, yet the president's wife, Mama Rachel Ruto, was absent.
“These people persecuted me and my wife when I was in office,” Gachagua told the congregation. “Because the president did not want me to be with my wife when he was not with his, due to protocol.”

The former DP also claimed that for two years during his tenure, he was restricted from walking or appearing publicly with his spouse. He alleged that on multiple instances, Pastor Dorcas was asked to leave official events, particularly when the first lady was absent.
Gachagua cited one instance during a high-profile government event to unveil Raila Odinga's African Union Commission bid, where the First Lady's absence prompted organisers to ask Pastor Dorcas to leave as well.
“I said no. Why did they call her then? I told them to tell the President that my wife is not leaving,” Gachagua recalled. “If Mama Ida [Raila’s wife] leaves, my wife will leave. And I told him if she goes, I will also go.”
The former DP narrated that his wife was ultimately allowed to remain at the event, and she got the opportunity to pray for Raila.
Gachagua's narration was a direct response to Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi, who had earlier questioned his increased public appearances with his wife, which the lawmaker termed unnecessary.
The former number two, however, stood his ground, saying his commitment to family values is non-negotiable.
“This is personal. I walk with my wife by choice. Not everything is about politics,” he added. 
During the same church service, Gachagua also commented on the current state of the opposition, dismissing the Kenya Kwanza government's calls for Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka to join them.

Ruto Sacks Road Contractor,"President William Ruto on Sunday, June 15, left a congregation stunned after openly dismissing a road contractor for incompetence.
The president spoke during a church service in Kivaywa, where he issued a declaration about the government's frustration over delayed infrastructure projects. While citing one specific road in Butere, Ruto revealed he had sacked a contractor over prolonged delays.
President William Ruto has publicly dismissed a contractor working on a road project in Butere, Kakamega County, citing a lack of progress and warning that non-performing contractors will no longer be tolerated.
“There is a road that has posed a challenge, but I will look for another contractor. I have told the one in place to go look for another job,” said Ruto.

The president's move was met with applause from the crowd, as he promised to oversee road projects in the Western region with more reliable contractors.
He added, “For the rest of the stalled road, we have already paid contractors. They should finish these roads because it will ease transport and grow the Kakamega economy.”
The Head of State further revealed that his administration would launch six new road projects in Kakamega, reaffirming his government's commitment to improving infrastructure in the western region.
On rural electrification, Ruto admitted delays but said affirmative action had been taken to ramp up connections in Western Kenya. According to the president, there was an allocation of Ksh3 billion for the rural electrification program targeting 85,000 households.
“I know that on power, we have lagged behind. That is why I have taken affirmative action. From June 15, the work begins. I have told them that by December, over 35,000 houses should be connected to electricity so we can focus on the next phase next year,"" Ruto added.
Beyond Kakamega, Ruto also disclosed that he had dispatched Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi to China to represent him in high-level talks that could unlock major trade and infrastructure deals for Kenya.
Mudavadi is also expected to lobby for funding towards the construction of the Rironi–Mau Summit–Eldoret–Bungoma–Malaba highway. Ruto noted that due to limited resources, the highway may be built in phases rather than as a single rollout.
The construction process is set to begin in August. Meanwhile, the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) plans to invest billions of Kenyans' savings into constructing the Nairobi–Rironi–Mau Summit Highway if its joint bid with the China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) is successful.
Ruto's dismissal of a contractor was in a similar fashion to that of Nakuru Governor Susan Kihika, who dismissed her speechwriter for making an error in her Madaraka Day speech.
While delivering her speech on Sunday, June 1, a hilarious moment erupted as the governor was outlining the ongoing projects in the county after she mistakenly referred to the Wanyororo Vocational Training Centre in Kabatini as the now-famous 'Wamunyoro', the home of the former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua.

Kenya Police Wins First-Ever Premier League Title,"Kenya Police secured their maiden title convincingly after a narrow 1-0 victory over Shabana FC on Sunday, June 15, to break the dominance of Gor Mahia and Tusker FC.
Brian Okoth scored the only goal of the game as his second-half header gave the 11-year-old club a victory in a game that had very little pressure.
Going into the final game of the season, Kenya Police only needed a solitary point to clinch their first-ever Kenya Premier League crown at the expense of familiar contenders Gor Mahia, who are the most successful club in the competition's history.
Shabana, infamous for their overzealous fans, had an outside chance of clinching the title going into the final weeks of the season, but they eventually fell off in the race and were heading against Police FC solely looking to spoil the party.

For Gor Mahia, they will be kicking themselves at what is possibly a missed opportunity, thanks to a couple of dropped points in recent weeks. Many pundits have argued that the 1-1 draw against AFC Leopards on June 2 in Homa Bay sealed their fate.
K'Ogalo secured a 3-2 win over Ulinzi Stars on Sunday, but it was too little, too late, as Kenya Police had done just enough to get over the line. 
Dig Deeper: Kenya Police's victory in the Premier League is commendable for a number of reasons. Founded in 2014, the team has been on a steady ascent to the top.
Nicknamed 'Makarao,' they achieved promotion to the top tier in 2021, and at the time, some critics saw them as flukes who would easily get relegated again.
However, their debut Premier League campaign culminated in an impressive third-place finish in 2023–24, and the Kenya Police Service-owned club effectively stamped their mark as a team that was in the top tier to stay.
In the same season, Kenya Police also won the FKF President’s Cup for the first time, which earned them a place in the 2024–25 CAF Confederation Cup.
November 2024 proved to be a turning point for the Kenya Police after the appointment of Burundian coach Etienne Ndayiragije, who was a key factor in the team's success this season.
Following their victory, the Kenya Police are set to bag several accolades, including a Ksh5 million prize and the coveted trophy.
In addition, the Law Enforcers are also set to feature in the most prestigious club competition in Africa—the CAF Champions League, which brings together the top club teams from across the continent, who qualify by performing well in their national leagues.

"Ruto Reveals Why He Sent Mudavadi to China, Months After Visit","President William Ruto has dispatched Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi to China to represent him in high-level talks that could unlock major trade and infrastructure deals for Kenya.
Speaking during a church service at Friends Comprehensive School in Kivaywa in Kakamega County, Ruto said the trip is aimed at securing financing for key national projects, including the extension of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to Malaba.
Mudavadi is also expected to lobby for funding towards the construction of the Rironi–Mau Summit–Eldoret–Bungoma–Malaba highway. Ruto noted that due to limited resources, the highway may be built in phases rather than as a single rollout.
The construction process is set to begin in August. Meanwhile, the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) plans to invest billions of Kenyans' savings into constructing the Nairobi–Rironi–Mau Summit Highway if its joint bid with the China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) is successful.

The planned construction of the road, expected to ease congestion and enhance trade and travel between Kenya and its neighbours in the west, comes amid public concerns over the use of pension funds for infrastructure development.
At the heart of the China visit is also a push for a new trade agreement, as Kenya continues to await the outcome of potential negotiations with the US on the future of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).
""You know that we are now producing on a large scale avocados, tea, coffee, and macadamia. All that needs a market, and we have been signing agreements among them with the UK, the US, and now we have one with China,"" Ruto announced.  
""Musalia and his team are working on the Chinese market, and we hope that in the next three or four months we will be able to conclude that so that our products can have access to a larger market,"" he added. 
President Ruto, who last visited China in April, has faced criticism over his diplomatic balancing act between Beijing and Washington. During his trip, he defended Kenya’s cooperation with China amid growing pressure from the United States, which has increasingly scrutinised the nature of Chinese investments in Africa.
While China remains a key trading partner for the US, it is also viewed as a strategic rival. The two global superpowers have clashed over trade practices, with Washington accusing Beijing of unfair economic tactics—tensions that have complicated diplomatic relations for countries like Kenya seeking to engage both sides.
The Head of State said Kenya's cooperation with China is mainly in the spirit of multilateralism. In an interview with the China Global Television Network (CGTN), he stated that multilateralism, a system where multiple countries collaborate to achieve common goals, was key to achieving fairer trade.
The latest comes after US Senator and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Jim Risch raised concerns over Kenya’s growing ties with China, calling for a reassessment of the relationship between Kenya and the US.
Responding to Ruto's April visit to Beijing, Senator Risch warned that Kenya’s deepening partnership with China signals more than just an economic partnership and could indicate a shift in global allegiances.
Speaking during a Senate hearing on East Africa and the Horn of Africa on Tuesday, May 13, Risch pointed to Ruto’s remarks where he declared that Kenya and China are “co-architects of a new world order.”
According to the Senator, such comments reflect a high level of alignment with China that should prompt the US to reconsider its engagement with Kenya.
“Just last month, President Ruto declared that Kenya, a major non-NATO ally, and China are co-architects of a new world order.” That’s not just alignment to China; it’s allegiance,” the statement read in part.
During his China trip, Ruto signed deals amounting to Ksh100 billion spanning across several areas of development in Kenya’s economy.

"CS Chirchir Fires 6 NTSA Officials, Hires 61 Others","The Transport Cabinet Secretary, Davis Chirchir, has made 61 appointments and revoked six earlier appointments to County Transport and Safety Committees.
In a notice in the Kenya Gazette issue of June 13, the CS announced that the 61 would serve as members in the committees of the different counties.

The Marsabit and Kakamega Counties have also received two appointees each, while the Kisii, Meru and Machakos Counties have received one each.
Apart from the new appointments, Chirchir also revoked the previous appointments of six committee members across five different counties in the same gazette notice.
""The appointments of the persons whose names appear in the second column of the Second Schedule who were appointed as Members of County Transport and Safety Committees indicated in the third column vide the Gazette Notice indicated in the fourth column are revoked,"" the notice read.
Those who got the axe are two from Kakamega and one each from Marsabit, Machakos, Meru and Kisii.
The six had been appointed in a similar gazette notice in 2024 to serve a term of three years starting February 16, 2024. The reason for the revocation just over a year into their term has yet to be revealed.
CS Chirchir was not the only one who made government appointments. His cabinet colleague, Lands CS Alice Wahome, appointed Annet Sision Lempee as a board member of the Kajiado West Land Control for three years.
She also appointed the Deputy County Commissioner, William Ngochila Ole Kakimon, as the chairman of the Elangata-Waus Land Control Board, Kajiado West, tapping the administration officer as the secretary and the Sub-County Agricultural Officer, Ruto Joseph, as a member of the board.
Other members of the board include Joel Kisau Sayianka, Kanjori, Ole Singeen, Judith Ntimipili, Raphael Maraunta Kipas, Peter Lopejo, Kayie Tiampati, Janet Parori, Jeremia Mepukori Nairowua, and Naisei Loibuluenkop.

KRA Announces Mass Auction of Uncollected Goods Including Cars,"The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has announced a mass auction targeting a backlog of uncollected goods within the next two months.
In a gazzette notice, the KRA revealed the hundreds of uncollected goods are currently held at the Customs Warehouse at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA), Nairobi.
According to the taxman, the online auction will run for five days between July 28 and August 1, 2025, through the KRA's official portal.
""Notice is given that unless the under-mentioned goods are entered and removed from the custody of the Customs Warehouse Keeper, Forodha JKIA, within thirty (30) days from the date of this notice, they will be treated as abandoned and will be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of EACCMA 2004,"" the gazette notice read. 
""This includes being sold by public auction on 28th July, 2025, 29th July, 2025, 30th July, 2025, 31st July, 2025, and 1st August, 2025 through an online portal,"" the notice added.

The taxman intends to auction the uncollected goods in line with Section 42 of the East African Community Customs Management Act, 2004, as amended (EACCMA, 2004).
The act grants the Commissioner of Customs (in this as the KRA) the authority to publish a notice in a Gazette or a widely circulated newspaper if goods are not lawfully removed from the warehouse within thirty days of their deposit.
Among the goods set to be auctioned are personal effects, clothing, shoes, printed materials, and electronics, among other assorted items that have overstayed at the JKIA Forodha Customs Warehouse.
Notably, several high-end vehicles are also set for auction as per the KRA notice. A quick spot check by Kenyans.co.ke revealed models including a Toyota Prado, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru Forester, Toyota Fielder, Toyota Harrier and Honda Vezel have been listed as uncollected by KRA.
Interested buyers can view the goods between July 24 and July 25 at the KRA's official warehouse during official working hours. This is to give potential bidders a chance to inspect the items before official bidding online.
Further, KRA warned importers and consignees against leaving goods uncollected beyond their legally allowed storage, as they risk being classified as abandoned, after which the KRA will be compelled to auction them to recover government dues.  
In March, a similar auction was announced where unclaimed items, including sofa sets, chairs, car parts, and other goods, were put up for auction.

How Police Caught Woman Smuggling Ksh4M Worth of Cocaine at JKIA,"Detectives on Friday arrested a 26-year-old Kenyan woman who attempted to smuggle cocaine through Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) by ingesting drug pellets.
According to a police report, the suspect—whose confidence seemingly outweighed her carry-on luggage—was intercepted by hawk-eyed officers on June 13, 2025, at around 10am, just minutes before boarding an outbound flight. Her uneasy demeanour during a routine screening raised suspicion, prompting further checks.
She was subjected to a thorough search, after which officers suspected she had concealed foreign substances internally. She was immediately placed under medical observation.
The detectives, in coordination with other government units at the airport, embarked on a medical response to make her release the swallowed narcotics.

Later that day, the woman requested to use the washroom, where she excreted two pellets. By the following day, June 14, she had passed six more, bringing the total to eight cocaine-filled pellets. 
""The woman, whose confidence was clearly larger than her carry-on luggage, was intercepted by hawk-eyed detectives on June 13, 2025, at around 10 am, just minutes before boarding an outbound flight. Her uneasy demeanour during a routine screening set off alarm bells,"" the DCI shared in a report.
''Following this, she was subjected to a thorough search. It was soon established that she had concealed foreign substances inside her body cavity, prompting immediate medical observation.''
The recovered pellets contained cocaine weighing approximately 626.65 grams, which, according to the current market value, could cost approximately Ksh4.39 million. 
JKIA’s Anti-Narcotics Unit has since launched preparations to arraign her in court on Monday following the completion of investigations. 
In a related incident, detectives arrested a United States citizen who ingested several pellets of cocaine in a bid to traffic them from Alabama to Saudi Arabia on February 19 this year. 
According to the detectives, the suspected trafficker was nabbed after a tip-off from a doctor at a hospital in Nairobi. Moments after being admitted, the doctor promptly alerted anti-narcotics detectives from DCI Headquarters, who visited the facility to witness an endoscopy process on the suspect.
During the process, three pellets were recovered from the suspect's rectum, which turned out to be cocaine weighing 57.98 grams. The DCI officers took the pellets and documented the incident.

Governor Implicated in Abduction & Torture of Top County Official,"Vocal Africa CEO Hussein Khalid has opened the lid on an unsolved abduction case involving a former county official of a county in the northeastern region.
In a statement on Sunday, June 15, Khalid revealed that the former Chief Officer for Health in the county had recently been abducted and tortured, allegedly by the county governor, whom, due to legal reasons, we opt not to name at this time. 
Despite efforts to get justice for him, however, Khalid relayed that the relevant authorities had yet to make any arrests, although the evidence in the case is reportedly overwhelming.
""At Vocal Africa, we are presently following up on a matter where a former Chief Officer (Health) was abducted, apparently by the Governor of the same County and tortured,"" Khalid stated.

Although he did not provide more details on the matter, he stated that the evidence presented to police officers included clear CCTV footage implicating the governor.
Therefore, Khalid called for the intervention of the Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA) and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) to quickly resolve the matter.
""The matter has been reported at various police stations, yet no action has been taken despite the abductors being known and all evidence, including CCTV footage, being shared. We demand immediate action by IPOA and DCI to end impunity in the country.""
According to the human rights group in the county that is nested around six others, including Meru, Laikipia, Samburu, Marsabit, Garissa, and Wajir counties, residents and leaders are living in fear over incidents that have been termed as intimidation tactics.
Accompanying the statement were two images of the former county official, fresh from the hospital, with the drip still intact. The Members of the County Assembly have also claimed that their lives may be in danger since they filed a motion seeking to impeach the governor.
Reportedly, they have all switched off their phones and gone into hiding since filing the motion last Tuesday.
This report comes at a volatile time in the country, where cases of forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings have left Kenyans on edge.
Over the past week, activists and politicians have been calling for justice in the death of teacher-cum-blogger Albert Ojwang, who passed away in police custody after being arrested in Homa Bay and driven over 350km to Nairobi last weekend.
What followed later was an outpouring of love for Ojwang's father as Kenyans called for top officials in the government to be held accountable over the same.
The Deputy Inspector General of the Kenya Police Service, Eliud Lagat, who was the complainant in the case that landed Ojwang in police custody, is among the top officials being urged to resign by a section of Kenyans.
DCI boss Mohammed Amin and the Inspector General of Police, Douglas Kanja, are also facing backlash for reportedly peddling lies during the probe of the case at the Senate and the National Assembly.

Govt Gives Notice to Coastal Landowners,"The government has announced intentions to acquire land from property owners at the coast for the construction of multimillion-dollar road projects that are set to ease congestion and improve mobility over the region. 
The National Land Commission (NLC), on behalf of the Kenya Ports Authority, in a gazette notice, announced that the government had intended to acquire a total of 12.15 acres from seven landowners to pave the way for the project. 
The Mombasa Port Area Road Development Project (MPARDP)—which includes the Mombasa Bypass and the Kipevu New Container Terminal (KNTC) Link Road—is a strategic infrastructure project aimed at improving road connectivity and easing congestion around the Port of Mombasa.
''In pursuance of the Land Act, No. 6 of 2012, Part VIII, the National Land Commission, on behalf of Kenya Ports Authority (KPA), gives notice that the National Government intends to acquire the parcels of land listed below for the Mombasa Port Area Road Development Project in Mombasa County,"" NLC's notice read in part. 
Mombasa Port managed by the Kenya Ports Authority FACEBOOK
The project, which comprises the Mombasa Southern Bypass and the Kipevu New Container Terminal (KNTC) Link Road, is expected to improve the movement of cargo in and out of the port. It is part of efforts to streamline logistics by linking the port with key transport corridors, including the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) and the Northern Corridor.
According to officials, the Kipevu Link Road will enable direct access to the new container terminal, reducing delays caused by traffic jams in Mombasa’s CBD and around the port. 
The road will also connect to the Dongo Kundu Bypass, offering a direct route to the South Coast without relying on the Likoni Ferry.
The project is a key component of Kenya’s Vision 2030 and is jointly funded by the government and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). It is being implemented by the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA).
Meanwhile, NLC announced another fresh round of public inquiries into land earmarked for compulsory acquisition to pave the way for the Mombasa Port Area Road Development Project. 
The inquiries, scheduled for July 1, 2025, will be held at the Likoni Chief’s Office from 9am to 4pm and will involve several parcels within the Mombasa South/Block I area.
Among the affected properties is land owned by the KPA, which will be acquired for the construction of critical road links, including the Kipevu New Container Terminal Link Road. The exercise is being conducted on behalf of the KeNHA. 
In recent years, the government has completed key road and port infrastructure projects in the region. Notably, the Dongo Kundu Bypass, also known as the Mombasa Southern Bypass, was completed in phases and now provides an alternative route for traffic heading to the South Coast, bypassing the often-congested Likoni Ferry. 
The project includes a bridge over the Mwache Creek and has opened up new industrial zones around Miritini and Dongo Kundu.
Additionally, the Kipevu Oil Terminal II was commissioned to expand the port’s fuel handling capacity. The terminal, built by China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), has reduced ship waiting times and improved the efficiency of oil imports.
