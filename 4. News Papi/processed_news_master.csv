KeNHA Announces Temporary Closure of Bridge,Motorists Beware: Bridge Closure Announces for Repairs,"The Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) and Homa Bay County have announced the temporary closure of the Kanyadhiang' Bridge in Kendu Bay to allow for urgent repairs to the approach slab.
In a joint statement, KeNHA and Governor Gladys Wanga announced that the closure is effective from Saturday, June 14, and is expected to last several days as engineers work to restore the bridge’s full functionality.
''We wish to inform the public about the temporary closure of Kanyadhiang' Bridge in Kendu Bay to allow for urgent repairs on the approach slab,'' the joint statement read in part.
''We would like to assure all road users that while repair works are being carried out on the approach slab, the bridge's main structure remains completely safe and stable,'' the statement continued.

Despite the closure, KeNHA has assured the public that the main structure of the bridge remains safe and stable, with only the approach slab requiring reinforcement.
The Authority has deployed teams to fast-track the repair process, ensuring minimal disruption to road users.
While the repairs continue, motorists travelling towards Kindi Bay have been advised to use alternative routes, including a diversion route via the Goshen Hotel, Oluch Intake Bridge, Nyangajo Primary School, and Obama Road, which will reconnect them to the main highway.
Those coming from the Homa Bay direction have been directed to follow the same route in reverse. The alternative path spans approximately five kilometres.
Traffic marshals and police have been strategically positioned to ensure compliance among motorists.
''We request all road users to drive carefully and follow instructions from traffic police and marshals stationed at the diversion points,'' the statement continued.
While the exact day when the bridge will be reopened has not been revealed, KeNHA anticipates that normal traffic flow will resume shortly after the completion of repairs.
KeNHA emphasised that the repairs are necessary to prevent further deterioration of the bridge, which has been experiencing structural strain due to increased traffic and heavy rainfall in recent months.

Charlene Ruto Proposes Way Forward on Albert Ojwang Murder,Ruto Offers Roadmap for Justice in Ojwang Murder Case,"President William Ruto's daughter, Charlene Ruto, has joined Kenyans in mourning the death of Albert Ojwang.
Breaking her silence on the incident that occurred a week ago, Charlene called for national reflection and a generational ceasefire to address rising cases of police brutality.
Speaking after the Youth Leadership Forum in Nairobi, Charlene led the 106 participants in observing a moment of silence for the 31-year-old teacher and social media influencer, whose death in police custody sparked public outrage.
She noted that the tragedy had driven her to deep reflection as she tried to understand the circumstances surrounding Ojwang’s death.

She revealed that the situation was both painful and unfortunate while extending her condolences to the bereaved family.
""I have struggled with deep moments of reflection for the past few days to try and find context around what happened. This is a painful, unfortunate and overwhelming loss, and we share our deepest condolences with his family,"" Charlene wrote in a Twitter post.
Ojwang, a well-known blogger and activist, was arrested in Homa Bay and later detained at Central Police Station in Nairobi, where he died under unclear circumstances.
In response, Charlene called for a generational ceasefire among the youth, urging a shift away from rising extremism, political hostility, and intolerance.
She challenged young people to take responsibility and work towards building the kind of society they wish to live in.
""As a young Kenyan, I would also like to challenge the entire country to embrace a generational ceasefire. These regrettable incidents, extremity and growing intolerance should challenge all of us as a nation to interrogate the environment and culture we want to live in and create for the generations coming after us,"" the President's daughter wrote.
Ojwang's death has become a symbol of Kenya's ongoing struggle with police brutality, which has claimed the lives of many.
Already, Nairobi Central Police OCS Samsob Talam, and Constable James Mukhwana, the sentry who was on duty when Ojwang was brought in, have been arrested as investigations into the incident death continue.

"Police Bust CBD-Based Phone Theft Syndicate, Recover 75 Phones",Cannabis Phones Stolen in Phone Theft Ring,"An intelligence-led operation by the National Police Service resulted in the arrest of three suspects believed to be part of a Nairobi-based phone theft syndicate.
Through a statement, officers revealed the arrest of the three on Friday, June 13, in the Tsavo area in the Central Business District (CBD).
Aside from the arrests, police recovered 75 mobile phones, seven computers, one microscope, and 20 Universal Flashing Interface (UFI) gadgets.
“On 13 June 2025, police officers from Nairobi Area conducted an intelligence-led operation along Tsavo Street in Nairobi’s Central Business District (CBD),” NPS stated.

“During the operation, three suspects were arrested, and 75 mobile phones, seven computers, one microscope, and twenty Universal Flashing Interface (UFI) gadgets were recovered,” they added.
The authorities disclosed that the suspects were in police custody as investigations continued, pending arraignment in court.
At the same time, the police warned the public against involvement in mobile phone theft syndicates and the illegal trade of flashing stolen phones, advising against buying devices from unauthorised dealers.
Phone theft, especially in the heart of Nairobi, is common, with reports of victims of phone theft emerging daily. Unconfirmed reports typically indicate that the stolen phones are taken to downtown Nairobi, where they are flashed and prepared for resale.
The result is a section of unsuspecting Kenyans purchasing these phones, unaware that they are putting themselves on the precipice of being caught on the wrong side of the law.
The phones are normally sold at affordable prices, with many eager to acquire the phones on such good deals. However, most of them do not know that, despite being unaware at the time of purchase, they can still be charged by law for the possession of a stolen mobile device if arrested by authorities.
Recently, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) in April announced the arrest of a phone thief behind a notorious phone theft syndicate in Naivasha.
Through a statement, DCI revealed that the suspect was caught red-handed as he was flashing his latest collection of stolen mobile phones. During the raid, detectives disclosed the recovery of 27 stolen phones, a laptop and the mobile flashing kit.

Why Irungu Nyakera Wants SGR Renamed 'Uhuru Rail',Uhuru's Legacy: Can the SGR Be Renamed in His Honor?,"Former Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC) chairperson Irungu Nyakera has suggested that the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) be renamed with a local name like Uhuru Rail to localise it and make it more profitable.
Since its construction, the SGR has been a transformative infrastructural project linking Nairobi and Mombasa while facilitating cargo transport across the country.
However, over the years, concerns have been raised over its performance, profitability, and viability to the country.
Recent reports indicated a decline in passenger numbers, prompting discussions on how to make it more efficient, profitable, and more Kenyan.

According to the latest data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), SGR passengers dropped by 282,000 last year compared to 2023. Cargo transport via SGR also saw a slight decline, with freight volume dropping from 6,533,000 tonnes in 2023 to 6,531,000 tonnes in 2024.
These declines led to a 50 per cent fare hike introduced in January 2024, which saw economy-class tickets rise from Ksh1,000 to Ksh1,500, and first-class fares jump from Ksh3,000 to Ksh4,500.
Following these developments, Nyakera listed 10 key steps Kenya can implement to improve SGR's performance. Among them is renegotiating SGR loan terms to extend repayment periods and lower interest rates.
Other critical recommendations he has made include the localisation of operations, ensuring that more Kenyan professionals are hired to manage and maintain the railway, switching from diesel to electric trains, and allowing trains to double-stack (carry an extra container on top), like other modern railways, to increase capacity.
He also suggested completing the Naivasha–Kampala line and prioritising the development of Kisumu Port, incentivising cargo from Mombasa by giving businesses tax or cost incentives to move cargo by rail instead of trucks, and building loading stations and dry ports next to industries to allow manufacturers to ship directly via SGR.
Nyakera also suggested growing the passenger services between major cities, allowing licensed private players like cement companies, logistics firms, and agri-exporters to run their own trains on the SGR, and renaming it with a local name.
According to Nyakera, renaming SGR to a new name like Uhuru Rail or KenRail will give it a Kenyan identity, making Kenyans own it more and reinforcing it as a national asset.
Nyakera believes that with these changes, SGR could reverse its passenger decline, improve cargo efficiency, and solidify its role as a cornerstone of national development

Another Kenyan Dies in Police Custody,Tragedy Grips Kenya: Another Death in Police Custody Sparks Outrage,"A stock theft suspect who had been held at the Katito Police Station in Kisumu has died while in police custody.
According to the station's police, the suspect died by suicide after he allegedly used his vest to hang himself on the cell door.
He had been arrested on suspicion of stealing goats and was held in solitary confinement. Police at the station said they were alerted to a commotion coming from the cell on June 13 at about 10:00 am.
Upon checking the source of the commotion, they realised the suspect had allegedly hanged himself.

His body was moved to the Nyando Morgue pending investigations.
This case comes barely two days after yet another suspect died by alleged suicide at the Ukwala police station in Siaya county on June 12.
The body of the 26-year-old was found hanging on a metal rod in the cells’ toilet, police said. He had been arrested following the issuance of a warrant by a court in the area.
The suspect had been accused of defilement. Police said he hanged himself in a toilet at the cells using his shirt.
According to the police at the Ukwala Police Station, the suspect was found hanging on a metal water pipe with his shirt around his neck.
These subsequent cases of alleged suicide in police stations follow the case of teacher and social media influencer Albert Ojwang, who police had initially alleged had died by suicide at the Central Police Station.
Police claimed Ojwang had self-inflicted injuries by hitting himself on the wall severally.
However, preliminary investigations by the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) and a government pathologist have disputed this claim, revealing that Ojwang died from head injuries, neck compression, and multiple bruises, suggesting blunt force trauma and strangulation.
These cases continue to raise questions about the safety of Kenyans in police custody, which is expected to be the safest place, yet is now turning out to be one of the most unsafe.

McDonald Mariga & Victor Wanyama Lose Mother,Tragedy Strikes Kenyan Stars: McDonald Mariga and Victor Wanyama Lose Mother,"Mildred Wanyama, the mother of Kenyan football legends Victor Wanyama and McDonald Mariga, is dead.
Through a statement released on Saturday, June 14, Mariga revealed the news of their mother’s passing, adding that she passed away in the early hours of Saturday.
He further added that burial arrangements were underway and that further details would be communicated soon.
“It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved mother, who left us peacefully today morning,” Mariga stated.
Mildred Wanyama, mother to McDonald Mariga and Victor Wanyama, speaking during a past interview.
DAILY NATION
He added: “We are currently making arrangements and will share more details soon! Thank you.”
Mildred, a sporting icon herself, was married to Noah Wanyama, a former footballer who played for AFC Leopards. Together, they had five children: four boys and one girl. Their children include Mariga, Victor, Thomas and Sylvester Wanyama, who are all footballers, and Mercy Wanyama, a professional basketballer in Spain.
Mildred was a netball player in her youth. She met her husband, Noah, in the 1970s when they were both working for Kenya Railways and involved in sports.
She was known for being very supportive of her children's careers and expressed immense pride in their achievements.
Famously, she intervened when Mariga, her eldest son, considered joining the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) after Form Three, insisting he complete his secondary education. This decision was significant, as it later paved the way for his future success on the European football stage with Italian giants Inter Milan.
With Victor, she has been highlighted as crucial to nurturing the talents of a child who would later become the first Kenyan to play in the prestigious English Premier League (EPL).
Victor also ascended to the role of national team captain, leading the Harambee Stars in the 2019 African Cup of Nations, the first time Kenya featured in more than a decade.
Beyond motherhood, she was a trailblazer in women’s sports administration, holding senior leadership positions within netball.
Notably, she held the position of Kenya Netball Federation President from 2014 to 2018. 
Aside from that, she actively participated in community and family events, always projecting an image of strength and grace. Her presence at her children's significant milestones, both on and off the field, was a constant source of pride for the family.

Outrage Erupts Over Police Social Media Post,Police Brutality: Viral Video Triggers Outcry and Demands for Accountability,"It is officially the third Sunday of June, the day set aside to celebrate fathers worldwide. True to form, several government institutions have already started celebrating Father's Day through sentimental posters on social media.
Leading the pack at quarter to 6am was the National Police Service (NPS), which took to social media to celebrate fathers in a simple Father's Day post, unaccompanied by any sentimental caption.
However, the stealth post did not escape Kenyans' attention, as they came out of the woodwork early Sunday morning to criticise the institution's recent miscarriage of justice that left a father childless and a child fatherless.
In a series of replies, Kenyans reminded the police service of the death of blogger and teacher Albert Ojwang in custody, who was the only child of his father.
A Father's Day post by the National Police Service on Sunday, June 15, 2025. PHOTO NATIONAL POLICE SERVICE
""It is not a happy Father's Day for Baba Albert Ojwang and Albert's son,"" one such user stated, followed by another one, writing, ""he was also someone's father,"" with an image of Ojwang.
""What is happy about Father's Day when you are making children fatherless?"" another quipped.
Within the hour, the comment section turned into a tribute to Albert Ojwang, who left behind an infant son and a heartbroken father after his death at Central Police Station last weekend.
The post highlighted the mistrust that has festered between the police and civilians, a sentiment that was captured by one X user, asserting that even police officers' children now feel ashamed of their parents' professions.

Activist Hanifa Adan, who currently writes for the Daily Nation, even dedicated her weekly column to commemorating Ojwang with her article titled ""Father's Day Without a Son: Tears for Albert Ojwang.""
In the same X streets, the first daughter, Charlene Ruto, received a fair share of criticism after posting about her father, President William Ruto, celebrating him on the special day.
As expected, Kenyans laid out their complaints about the president in her comments section, also reflecting on Ojwang's death.
""At least you get to celebrate your father this Father’s Day. Albert would have loved to do the same, to sit with his dad, laugh, and share a meal, but those who murdered him felt so powerful, so untouchable, they played God, deciding who lives and who dies,"" one of the top comments read.
""You’ve been parading yourself as a youth leader, yet you’ve said nothing about Albert’s death. A young man was killed. As for your father... I won’t even go there. The mere thought of his name boils my blood! Just let him know that Kenyans have unanimously endorsed his Wantam!""

CCTV Footage of Albert Ojwang's Last Moments Emerges,Witness the Final Hours of Kenya's Missing Tycoon: CCTV Footage Surfaces,"A new twist has emerged in the murder case of blogger Albert Ojwang after CCTV footage of his final moments surfaced.
In the clip seen by Kenyans.co.ke, a police vehicle is seen driving into Mbagathi Hospital at 1:35 am. Three officers then emerge from the vehicle, and two of them engage in a brief conversation before walking towards the casualty section of the health facility.
During this time, Ojwang remains at the back of the vehicle, unattended. The officers then reappear at 1:37 am and seem to be making phone calls.
A police vehicle carrying the remains of Albert Ojwang arrives at Mbagathi Hospital on June 8, 2025.
At 1:46 am, two officers emerge from the hospital with a stretcher that is later used to carry Ojwang. They take approximately 12 minutes before loading him onto the stretcher, after requesting assistance from a hospital guard.
Police load Albert Ojwang onto a stretcher at 1:59 am.
Notably, this is now 24 minutes since the police vehicle arrived, highlighting the lack of urgency in attending to Ojwang.
The officers then spend a further 10 minutes in the casualty section and, at 2:11 am, wheel out Ojwang's body, seemingly after the hospital confirmed that the blogger was deceased.
Albert Ojwang is wheeled out of Mbagathi Hospital at 2:11 am.
At 2:15 am, the police vehicle leaves the hospital with the remains of the late Ojwang.
The footage closely matches an earlier report by medics at Mbagathi Hospital, who noted that Ojwang was brought to the facility at around 2 am on June 8 and was unresponsive.
The report indicated that Ojwang had extensive injuries and a swollen face. His limbs also bore a series of severe bruises, highlighting the violent nature of the attack.
This development comes just a day after another suspect was arrested by authorities on allegations of deleting CCTV footage at Nairobi's Central Police Station, where Ojwang was held before his death.
The man is said to have been arrested on the morning of Friday, June 13, in a supposed targeted operation at his residence in a populous Nairobi estate.

According to sources privy to the situation, the technician, who had overseen the installation of all 25 cameras at the station in 2024, was called on June 8, by a police officer at Central Police Station. Aside from the cameras, the man also installed a digital video recorder (DVR) where all captured footage is stored.
The man claims that the officer urged him to report to the station immediately. Upon arrival, he was taken to the office of a senior officer, where the DVR is housed and was allegedly asked to delete footage from Thursday, June 6, and Friday, June 7.","New CCTV footage shows a police vehicle arriving at Mbagathi Hospital with blogger Albert Ojwang at 1:35 am.

In the review released on Saturday, June 14, EPRA revealed that petrol had increased by Ksh2.69 per litre, while diesel and kerosene had decreased by Ksh1.95 and Ksh2.06 per litre, respectively.
Consequently, super petrol will retail at Ksh177.32, diesel at Ksh162.91, and kerosene at Ksh146.93 per litre in Nairobi. 
EPRA noted that the calculated maximum retail prices of petroleum products will be in force from Saturday, June 15, to Monday, July 14.

""The prices are inclusive of the 16% Value Added Tax (VAT) in line with the provisions of the Finance Act 2023, the Tax Laws (Amendment) Act 2024, and the revised rates for excise duty adjusted for inflation as per Legal Notice No. 194 of 2020,"" it added.
In Mombasa, super petrol, diesel, and kerosene will all retail at Ksh174.01, Ksh159.62 and Ksh143.64 per litre, respectively. In the lakeside region of Kisumu, the prices of super petrol, diesel and kerosene were set at Ksh177.28, Ksh163.23 and Ksh147.30 per litre, respectively.
Super petrol in Nakuru will retail at Ksh176.47 per litre. Meanwhile, diesel and kerosene will retail at Ksh162.41 and Ksh146.47 per litre, respectively. In Eldoret, super petrol, diesel and kerosene will retail at Ksh177.28, Ksh163.24 and Ksh147.30 per litre, respectively.
According to EPRA, the average landed cost of imported super petrol increased by 0.35 per cent from US$588.16 (Ksh76,166) per cubic metre in April 2025 to US$590.24 (Ksh76,436) in May 2025.
Conversely, diesel decreased by 2.42 per cent from US$594.60 (Ksh77,000) per cubic metre to US$580.23 (Ksh75,139) while Kerosene decreased by 5.14 per cent from US$599.84 (Ksh77,679) per cubic metre to US$569.00 (Ksh73,685) per cubic metre over the same period.
EPRA explained that the price of petroleum products was based on global market trends, as Kenya does not produce or refine its own petroleum; it imports already processed fuel from other countries.
The latest prices are expected to be received with mixed feelings, as motorists on Kenyan roads drive both super petrol and diesel-fuelled vehicles.
Even so, attention now shifts to next month, as Kenyans remain on the lookout for global oil price movements and upcoming EPRA reviews.

Babu Owino Sounds Alarm Over Masked Police at Protests,Babu Owino! 🚨 Alert! 🕰 Police in Mask! 🔥 Protests!,"Embakasi East MP Paul Ongili, popularly known as Babu Owino, has called on Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja to enforce a court ruling that bars police officers from wearing facial masks during protests.
In an official statement, Babu condemned the continued defiance of the ruling issued by Justice Bahati Mwamuye, which declared the use of masks by officers during public demonstrations unconstitutional.
Justice Mwamuye ruled that the use of face coverings by law enforcement officers, especially during protests, violates the principles of accountability and transparency and hinders the identification of state agents when exercising coercive power.
The MP expressed his frustrations that, despite the ruling, officers continued covering their faces during public protests.

“It is unacceptable that despite this judicial pronouncement, certain elements within the police service continue to disregard the law with impunity,” Babu stated.
To ensure that the police remain compliant with this ruling, Babu has called upon Kanja to issue an immediate directive that will ensure the police are following the rule.
“No officer should engage the public in anonymity, especially while wielding force in the name of the state,” Babu continued.
According to the MP, Kenya should not be left to slide back into a culture of faceless repression. Babu emphasised the importance of all Kenyans, including officers, obeying the law.
“The law is clear, and it must be obeyed by all, especially by those entrusted to enforce it,” the MP continued.
Police officers have been spotted covering their faces during public protests while using force to disperse Kenyans. The latest case was witnessed on Thursday, June 12.
During the protests, where Kenyans had taken to the streets to demand justice for Albert Ojwang, who had died in police custody, Shakira Wafula, an activist, approached an officer and forcibly pulled off his mask. The officer was part of a contingent deployed to repulse protesters who gathered in the city.
In videos that made the rounds online, Wafula was seen striving to reach for the cloth covering his face, which she grabbed and began pulling off while the officer tried to block her. She eventually pulled it off and quickly ran away.
The issue of masked police officers gained national attention during the 2024 Gen Z protests, when it was noted that these officers killed some protestors, but identifying them became difficult as they had hidden their faces.
