Govt to Begin Arrest of Protestors,"The Nairobi County Government has warned that those who were involved in the destruction of infrastructure within the city during the protests last week will be apprehended.
Speaking in Kamagut on Saturday, June 14, Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja claimed that investigations by security agencies have already uncovered who vandalised county infrastructure and other properties across the city during demonstrations.
According to Sakaja, the individuals, whom he labelled as 'criminals,' who masqueraded as protesters and destroyed the recently installed lighting and sanitation infrastructure, eclipsed the original motive of the demonstrations, which was to protest the recent death of Albert Ojwang, who died in police custody on Sunday, June 8.
“Even if we are angry, let’s not destroy our property. If we must demonstrate, let us do so peacefully. The next time, let no one try to destroy infrastructure, burn cars, steal from businesses, or cause chaos,” Sakaja said.

“The Constitution allows peaceful demonstrations, not violence. We must protect our businesses. What happened will not be allowed to happen again,” he added.
According to Umoja, one MCA, Ronald Mugambi, the destruction of property during demonstrations undermined the solid infrastructural progress the country's capital has engineered over the years.
“Don’t destroy what has taken us years to build. We will not allow this to continue—people losing their businesses and infrastructure being vandalised. Next time they try, we will ensure the law takes its course,” the MCA said.
Echoing the Nairobi official's statements in the same event, the National Assembly Majority leader, Kimani Ichung'wah, stressed the need for the public to remain peaceful during their demonstrations. According to Ichung'wah, the government will not allow vandalising county infrastructure.
“Nairobi will not become Mogadishu. We cannot allow this. Those burning county assets, destroying businesses, setting vehicles on fire, and vandalising infrastructure are not seeking justice—that is criminal behaviour, not a pursuit of justice,” he said.
On Thursday, June 12, some of the protesters who took to the streets to demonstrate against the recent death of Albert Ojwang were seen uninstalling the newly erected dustbins and streetlights, which are barely a month old.
In videos seen by Kenyans.co.ke, a number of the bins were removed from their original posts, with protesters carrying them along the road as they dragged them along.
Speaking when the installation kicked off on Sunday, May 18, Nairobi County Chief Officer for Environment, Mosiria, stated that the bins were put in place to serve pedestrians after the previously installed ones were stolen.
On the other hand, the county government had installed modern street lighting systems, which Sakaja asserts will be fundamental in enhancing the visibility, security, and ambience of the city.
After their installation, the county had issued stern warnings to both city dwellers and hawkers against destroying them.

Outrage Erupts Over Police Social Media Post,"It is officially the third Sunday of June, the day set aside to celebrate fathers worldwide. True to form, several government institutions have already started celebrating Father's Day through sentimental posters on social media.
Leading the pack at quarter to 6am was the National Police Service (NPS), which took to social media to celebrate fathers in a simple Father's Day post, unaccompanied by any sentimental caption.
However, the stealth post did not escape Kenyans' attention, as they came out of the woodwork early Sunday morning to criticise the institution's recent miscarriage of justice that left a father childless and a child fatherless.
In a series of replies, Kenyans reminded the police service of the death of blogger and teacher Albert Ojwang in custody, who was the only child of his father.
A Father's Day post by the National Police Service on Sunday, June 15, 2025. PHOTO NATIONAL POLICE SERVICE
""It is not a happy Father's Day for Baba Albert Ojwang and Albert's son,"" one such user stated, followed by another one, writing, ""he was also someone's father,"" with an image of Ojwang.
""What is happy about Father's Day when you are making children fatherless?"" another quipped.
Within the hour, the comment section turned into a tribute to Albert Ojwang, who left behind an infant son and a heartbroken father after his death at Central Police Station last weekend.
The post highlighted the mistrust that has festered between the police and civilians, a sentiment that was captured by one X user, asserting that even police officers' children now feel ashamed of their parents' professions.
""The mistrust between the public and police makes your children think twice before introducing themselves to peers as the offspring of policemen. It is not as simple as introducing oneself as ""my father is a pilot, doctor, engineer or plant operator',"" the user wrote.
Activist Hanifa Adan, who currently writes for the Daily Nation, even dedicated her weekly column to commemorating Ojwang with her article titled ""Father's Day Without a Son: Tears for Albert Ojwang.""
In the same X streets, the first daughter, Charlene Ruto, received a fair share of criticism after posting about her father, President William Ruto, celebrating him on the special day.
As expected, Kenyans laid out their complaints about the president in her comments section, also reflecting on Ojwang's death.
""At least you get to celebrate your father this Father’s Day. Albert would have loved to do the same, to sit with his dad, laugh, and share a meal, but those who murdered him felt so powerful, so untouchable, they played God, deciding who lives and who dies,"" one of the top comments read.
""You’ve been parading yourself as a youth leader, yet you’ve said nothing about Albert’s death. A young man was killed. As for your father... I won’t even go there. The mere thought of his name boils my blood! Just let him know that Kenyans have unanimously endorsed his Wantam!""

CCTV Footage of Albert Ojwang's Last Moments Emerges,"A new twist has emerged in the murder case of blogger Albert Ojwang after CCTV footage of his final moments surfaced.
In the clip seen by Kenyans.co.ke, a police vehicle is seen driving into Mbagathi Hospital at 1:35 am. Three officers then emerge from the vehicle, and two of them engage in a brief conversation before walking towards the casualty section of the health facility.
During this time, Ojwang remains at the back of the vehicle, unattended. The officers then reappear at 1:37 am and seem to be making phone calls.
A police vehicle carrying the remains of Albert Ojwang arrives at Mbagathi Hospital on June 8, 2025.
At 1:46 am, two officers emerge from the hospital with a stretcher that is later used to carry Ojwang. They take approximately 12 minutes before loading him onto the stretcher, after requesting assistance from a hospital guard.
Police load Albert Ojwang onto a stretcher at 1:59 am.
Notably, this is now 24 minutes since the police vehicle arrived, highlighting the lack of urgency in attending to Ojwang.
The officers then spend a further 10 minutes in the casualty section and, at 2:11 am, wheel out Ojwang's body, seemingly after the hospital confirmed that the blogger was deceased.
Albert Ojwang is wheeled out of Mbagathi Hospital at 2:11 am.
At 2:15 am, the police vehicle leaves the hospital with the remains of the late Ojwang.
The footage closely matches an earlier report by medics at Mbagathi Hospital, who noted that Ojwang was brought to the facility at around 2 am on June 8 and was unresponsive.
The report indicated that Ojwang had extensive injuries and a swollen face. His limbs also bore a series of severe bruises, highlighting the violent nature of the attack.
This development comes just a day after another suspect was arrested by authorities on allegations of deleting CCTV footage at Nairobi's Central Police Station, where Ojwang was held before his death.
The man is said to have been arrested on the morning of Friday, June 13, in a supposed targeted operation at his residence in a populous Nairobi estate.

According to sources privy to the situation, the technician, who had overseen the installation of all 25 cameras at the station in 2024, was called on June 8, by a police officer at Central Police Station. Aside from the cameras, the man also installed a digital video recorder (DVR) where all captured footage is stored.
The man claims that the officer urged him to report to the station immediately. Upon arrival, he was taken to the office of a senior officer, where the DVR is housed and was allegedly asked to delete footage from Thursday, June 6, and Friday, June 7.",https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/113117-cctv-footage-shows-albert-ojwangs-final-moments
EPRA Announces Fuel Prices for June-July,"Super petrol prices are set to increase following the latest fuel review by the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA). On the other hand, prices for diesel and kerosene are set to decrease.
In the review released on Saturday, June 14, EPRA revealed that petrol had increased by Ksh2.69 per litre, while diesel and kerosene had decreased by Ksh1.95 and Ksh2.06 per litre, respectively.
Consequently, super petrol will retail at Ksh177.32, diesel at Ksh162.91, and kerosene at Ksh146.93 per litre in Nairobi. 
EPRA noted that the calculated maximum retail prices of petroleum products will be in force from Saturday, June 15, to Monday, July 14.

""In accordance with Section 101(y) of the Petroleum Act 2019 and Legal Notice No.192 of 2022, we have calculated the maximum retail prices of petroleum products which will be in force from June 15 to July 14,"" the statement read in part.
""The prices are inclusive of the 16% Value Added Tax (VAT) in line with the provisions of the Finance Act 2023, the Tax Laws (Amendment) Act 2024, and the revised rates for excise duty adjusted for inflation as per Legal Notice No. 194 of 2020,"" it added.
In Mombasa, super petrol, diesel, and kerosene will all retail at Ksh174.01, Ksh159.62 and Ksh143.64 per litre, respectively. In the lakeside region of Kisumu, the prices of super petrol, diesel and kerosene were set at Ksh177.28, Ksh163.23 and Ksh147.30 per litre, respectively.
Super petrol in Nakuru will retail at Ksh176.47 per litre. Meanwhile, diesel and kerosene will retail at Ksh162.41 and Ksh146.47 per litre, respectively. In Eldoret, super petrol, diesel and kerosene will retail at Ksh177.28, Ksh163.24 and Ksh147.30 per litre, respectively.
According to EPRA, the average landed cost of imported super petrol increased by 0.35 per cent from US$588.16 (Ksh76,166) per cubic metre in April 2025 to US$590.24 (Ksh76,436) in May 2025.
Conversely, diesel decreased by 2.42 per cent from US$594.60 (Ksh77,000) per cubic metre to US$580.23 (Ksh75,139) while Kerosene decreased by 5.14 per cent from US$599.84 (Ksh77,679) per cubic metre to US$569.00 (Ksh73,685) per cubic metre over the same period.
EPRA explained that the price of petroleum products was based on global market trends, as Kenya does not produce or refine its own petroleum; it imports already processed fuel from other countries.
The latest prices are expected to be received with mixed feelings, as motorists on Kenyan roads drive both super petrol and diesel-fuelled vehicles.
Even so, attention now shifts to next month, as Kenyans remain on the lookout for global oil price movements and upcoming EPRA reviews.

Kenya Air Force Plane Crashes,"Two Kenya Air Force officers were on Saturday, June 14, killed in a plane crash in Kwale County.
The officers were killed in Ndavaya, Kinango, in an incident that was confirmed by County Commissioner Stephen Orinde.
Further, the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) released a statement confirming the incident and also explained the circumstances that seemingly caused the crash.
Despite confirming two officers on board, they neither confirmed nor denied that the crash claimed the lives of the military personnel.

""Earlier today, 14th June 2025, a Kenya Air Force Grob 120A aircraft experienced an emergency while on a training flight in the general area of Mwakijembe Primary School, Ndavaya, Kwale County,' KDF stated.
""On Board were two pilots. Recovery is ongoing,"" added Kenya's military body.
According to flight records, the ill-fated aircraft departed Mombasa at 11:39 am and was last seen near Diani before disappearing from radar. It crashed at approximately 12:06 pm, just 27 minutes after takeoff.
Images obtained by Kenyans.co.ke showed the disintegrated state of the plane's wreckage, with the roof of the aircraft completely undone. 
Out of the cockpit, only the seats remained, with the nose of the plane left with just spare parts. 
Compared with the plane's tail, which had limited damage, the front section was completely damaged, supposedly signalling the plane nose-dived to the ground. 
The scene of the crash was an open field with vegetation, and other reports suggested that it was a common training area for military personnel. Aside from the two officers, no civilian casualties were reported at the time of publishing.
In the aftermath of the incident, curious onlookers started milling around the scene even as emergency response teams were deployed to the crash site to assist in search and recovery operations.

Babu Owino Sounds Alarm Over Masked Police at Protests,"Embakasi East MP Paul Ongili, popularly known as Babu Owino, has called on Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja to enforce a court ruling that bars police officers from wearing facial masks during protests.
In an official statement, Babu condemned the continued defiance of the ruling issued by Justice Bahati Mwamuye, which declared the use of masks by officers during public demonstrations unconstitutional.
Justice Mwamuye ruled that the use of face coverings by law enforcement officers, especially during protests, violates the principles of accountability and transparency and hinders the identification of state agents when exercising coercive power.
The MP expressed his frustrations that, despite the ruling, officers continued covering their faces during public protests.

“It is unacceptable that despite this judicial pronouncement, certain elements within the police service continue to disregard the law with impunity,” Babu stated.
To ensure that the police remain compliant with this ruling, Babu has called upon Kanja to issue an immediate directive that will ensure the police are following the rule.
“No officer should engage the public in anonymity, especially while wielding force in the name of the state,” Babu continued.
According to the MP, Kenya should not be left to slide back into a culture of faceless repression. Babu emphasised the importance of all Kenyans, including officers, obeying the law.
“The law is clear, and it must be obeyed by all, especially by those entrusted to enforce it,” the MP continued.
Police officers have been spotted covering their faces during public protests while using force to disperse Kenyans. The latest case was witnessed on Thursday, June 12.
During the protests, where Kenyans had taken to the streets to demand justice for Albert Ojwang, who had died in police custody, Shakira Wafula, an activist, approached an officer and forcibly pulled off his mask. The officer was part of a contingent deployed to repulse protesters who gathered in the city.
In videos that made the rounds online, Wafula was seen striving to reach for the cloth covering his face, which she grabbed and began pulling off while the officer tried to block her. She eventually pulled it off and quickly ran away.
The issue of masked police officers gained national attention during the 2024 Gen Z protests, when it was noted that these officers killed some protestors, but identifying them became difficult as they had hidden their faces.

World Leaders Raise Concern Over Kenya’s Capacity in Haiti Mission,"Kenya’s capacity to lead the Multinational Security Support Mission (MSSM) in Haiti has come under scrutiny once again after a world leader voiced dissatisfaction with the mission’s progress.
Brazil’s President, Inácio Lula da Silva, on Friday became the latest global figure to call for a stronger security presence in Haiti, as the underfunded and understaffed United Nations-backed mission continues to struggle against the country’s escalating gang crisis.
Speaking during a meeting with Caribbean nations in Brazil’s capital, Brasília, Lula urged the UN to either provide more funding for the current mission structure or upgrade it to an official UN peacekeeping operation.
He cited the mission’s importance to restoring stability to the gang-ridden nation and in the long-term ambitions of establishing democracy in the nation via holding Presidential Elections.

The mission is led by Kenyan forces, with additional support from personnel drawn from Jamaica, Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, and the Bahamas.
Currently, the United Nations manages the mission’s funding, which relies on voluntary contributions from member states. While several countries have pledged financial support, much of the money is yet to be disbursed. So far, the UN Trust Fund has confirmed pledges amounting to $96.8 million (approximately Ksh12.4 billion).
Kenya has been forced to spend its funds, with reports recently emerging that the country had allocated Ksh2.1 billion for the mission. This, however, put the President William Ruto-led administration on the spot, prompting a response from Foreign Affairs Principal Secretary Korir Sing’oei.
In November last year, the Principal Secretary clarified that the funds spent by Kenya would eventually be reimbursed, describing the arrangement as standard procedure. “This is the normal practice. The resources will certainly be reimbursed to Kenya. The financing mechanism for it is through a trust fund, which enables countries to make contributions,” he stated.
A transition to a formal UN peacekeeping mission, which would guarantee stable and predictable funding, would require approval by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). While the United States has expressed support for such a move, permanent members Russia and China, who hold veto powers, have opposed it.
In recent months, several world leaders, including those from France, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, and even the Haitian government, have joined the growing calls for increased support to stabilise Haiti.
For its part, Kenya had expressed its support for the Haitian government’s request to the Security Council to authorise planning for the transformation of the multinational force to a UN peacekeeping force. 
Monica Juma, the National Security Advisor to Ruto, in a previous address to the UNSC, voiced Kenya’s support in that regard. 
“Today, Haiti has appealed to the Security Council to consider the transformation of the MSS mission to a UN peacekeeping operation soon. Kenya strongly supports this appeal. A peacekeeping operation will avail greater resources to the mission predictably and sustainably. It will also provide a broader platform for collaboration and participation of more patterns,” she noted. 
Aside from the financial issues, Kenya’s mission in Haiti has reportedly been hampered by technical and administrative issues. Reports of Kenyan police officers lamenting about the lack of quality equipment to handle Haitian gangs have been reported.
Also, claims of the Haitian National Police (HNP) at loggerheads over the Mission’s effectiveness have emerged, but the Kenyan government has always shut down such reports.

KeNHA Announces Temporary Closure of Bridge,"The Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) and Homa Bay County have announced the temporary closure of the Kanyadhiang' Bridge in Kendu Bay to allow for urgent repairs to the approach slab.
In a joint statement, KeNHA and Governor Gladys Wanga announced that the closure is effective from Saturday, June 14, and is expected to last several days as engineers work to restore the bridge’s full functionality.
''We wish to inform the public about the temporary closure of Kanyadhiang' Bridge in Kendu Bay to allow for urgent repairs on the approach slab,'' the joint statement read in part.
''We would like to assure all road users that while repair works are being carried out on the approach slab, the bridge's main structure remains completely safe and stable,'' the statement continued.

Despite the closure, KeNHA has assured the public that the main structure of the bridge remains safe and stable, with only the approach slab requiring reinforcement.
The Authority has deployed teams to fast-track the repair process, ensuring minimal disruption to road users.
While the repairs continue, motorists travelling towards Kindi Bay have been advised to use alternative routes, including a diversion route via the Goshen Hotel, Oluch Intake Bridge, Nyangajo Primary School, and Obama Road, which will reconnect them to the main highway.
Those coming from the Homa Bay direction have been directed to follow the same route in reverse. The alternative path spans approximately five kilometres.
Traffic marshals and police have been strategically positioned to ensure compliance among motorists.
''We request all road users to drive carefully and follow instructions from traffic police and marshals stationed at the diversion points,'' the statement continued.
While the exact day when the bridge will be reopened has not been revealed, KeNHA anticipates that normal traffic flow will resume shortly after the completion of repairs.
KeNHA emphasised that the repairs are necessary to prevent further deterioration of the bridge, which has been experiencing structural strain due to increased traffic and heavy rainfall in recent months.

Charlene Ruto Proposes Way Forward on Albert Ojwang Murder,"President William Ruto's daughter, Charlene Ruto, has joined Kenyans in mourning the death of Albert Ojwang.
Breaking her silence on the incident that occurred a week ago, Charlene called for national reflection and a generational ceasefire to address rising cases of police brutality.
Speaking after the Youth Leadership Forum in Nairobi, Charlene led the 106 participants in observing a moment of silence for the 31-year-old teacher and social media influencer, whose death in police custody sparked public outrage.
She noted that the tragedy had driven her to deep reflection as she tried to understand the circumstances surrounding Ojwang’s death.

She revealed that the situation was both painful and unfortunate while extending her condolences to the bereaved family.
""I have struggled with deep moments of reflection for the past few days to try and find context around what happened. This is a painful, unfortunate and overwhelming loss, and we share our deepest condolences with his family,"" Charlene wrote in a Twitter post.
Ojwang, a well-known blogger and activist, was arrested in Homa Bay and later detained at Central Police Station in Nairobi, where he died under unclear circumstances.
In response, Charlene called for a generational ceasefire among the youth, urging a shift away from rising extremism, political hostility, and intolerance.
She challenged young people to take responsibility and work towards building the kind of society they wish to live in.
""As a young Kenyan, I would also like to challenge the entire country to embrace a generational ceasefire. These regrettable incidents, extremity and growing intolerance should challenge all of us as a nation to interrogate the environment and culture we want to live in and create for the generations coming after us,"" the President's daughter wrote.
Ojwang's death has become a symbol of Kenya's ongoing struggle with police brutality, which has claimed the lives of many.
Already, Nairobi Central Police OCS Samsob Talam, and Constable James Mukhwana, the sentry who was on duty when Ojwang was brought in, have been arrested as investigations into the incident death continue.

"Police Bust CBD-Based Phone Theft Syndicate, Recover 75 Phones","An intelligence-led operation by the National Police Service resulted in the arrest of three suspects believed to be part of a Nairobi-based phone theft syndicate.
Through a statement, officers revealed the arrest of the three on Friday, June 13, in the Tsavo area in the Central Business District (CBD).
Aside from the arrests, police recovered 75 mobile phones, seven computers, one microscope, and 20 Universal Flashing Interface (UFI) gadgets.
“On 13 June 2025, police officers from Nairobi Area conducted an intelligence-led operation along Tsavo Street in Nairobi’s Central Business District (CBD),” NPS stated.

“During the operation, three suspects were arrested, and 75 mobile phones, seven computers, one microscope, and twenty Universal Flashing Interface (UFI) gadgets were recovered,” they added.
The authorities disclosed that the suspects were in police custody as investigations continued, pending arraignment in court.
At the same time, the police warned the public against involvement in mobile phone theft syndicates and the illegal trade of flashing stolen phones, advising against buying devices from unauthorised dealers.
Phone theft, especially in the heart of Nairobi, is common, with reports of victims of phone theft emerging daily. Unconfirmed reports typically indicate that the stolen phones are taken to downtown Nairobi, where they are flashed and prepared for resale.
The result is a section of unsuspecting Kenyans purchasing these phones, unaware that they are putting themselves on the precipice of being caught on the wrong side of the law.
The phones are normally sold at affordable prices, with many eager to acquire the phones on such good deals. However, most of them do not know that, despite being unaware at the time of purchase, they can still be charged by law for the possession of a stolen mobile device if arrested by authorities.
Recently, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) in April announced the arrest of a phone thief behind a notorious phone theft syndicate in Naivasha.
Through a statement, DCI revealed that the suspect was caught red-handed as he was flashing his latest collection of stolen mobile phones. During the raid, detectives disclosed the recovery of 27 stolen phones, a laptop and the mobile flashing kit.

Why Irungu Nyakera Wants SGR Renamed 'Uhuru Rail',"Former Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC) chairperson Irungu Nyakera has suggested that the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) be renamed with a local name like Uhuru Rail to localise it and make it more profitable.
Since its construction, the SGR has been a transformative infrastructural project linking Nairobi and Mombasa while facilitating cargo transport across the country.
However, over the years, concerns have been raised over its performance, profitability, and viability to the country.
Recent reports indicated a decline in passenger numbers, prompting discussions on how to make it more efficient, profitable, and more Kenyan.

According to the latest data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), SGR passengers dropped by 282,000 last year compared to 2023. Cargo transport via SGR also saw a slight decline, with freight volume dropping from 6,533,000 tonnes in 2023 to 6,531,000 tonnes in 2024.
These declines led to a 50 per cent fare hike introduced in January 2024, which saw economy-class tickets rise from Ksh1,000 to Ksh1,500, and first-class fares jump from Ksh3,000 to Ksh4,500.
Following these developments, Nyakera listed 10 key steps Kenya can implement to improve SGR's performance. Among them is renegotiating SGR loan terms to extend repayment periods and lower interest rates.
Other critical recommendations he has made include the localisation of operations, ensuring that more Kenyan professionals are hired to manage and maintain the railway, switching from diesel to electric trains, and allowing trains to double-stack (carry an extra container on top), like other modern railways, to increase capacity.
He also suggested completing the Naivasha–Kampala line and prioritising the development of Kisumu Port, incentivising cargo from Mombasa by giving businesses tax or cost incentives to move cargo by rail instead of trucks, and building loading stations and dry ports next to industries to allow manufacturers to ship directly via SGR.
Nyakera also suggested growing the passenger services between major cities, allowing licensed private players like cement companies, logistics firms, and agri-exporters to run their own trains on the SGR, and renaming it with a local name.
According to Nyakera, renaming SGR to a new name like Uhuru Rail or KenRail will give it a Kenyan identity, making Kenyans own it more and reinforcing it as a national asset.
Nyakera believes that with these changes, SGR could reverse its passenger decline, improve cargo efficiency, and solidify its role as a cornerstone of national development

Govt Introduces Bold New Graphic Warnings on All Tobacco Products,"The Ministry of Health has introduced new graphic health warnings on all tobacco products nationwide.
Through a statement released on Friday, June 13, the ministry revealed it had gazetted the third batch of 13 warnings to promote effective tobacco control and the protection of public health.
The new warnings, which are also translated into Swahili and feature approved pictures and pictograms, must now appear on all tobacco product packaging.
“This intervention aims to increase public awareness of tobacco-related health risks, deter tobacco use, especially among youth, and protect non-smokers and vulnerable populations,” noted the ministry.

The first warning, split into two, reads “WARNING! SMOKING HARMS PEOPLE NEXT TO YOU” and “WARNING! THIS PRODUCT HARMS PEOPLE NEXT TO YOU.”
The second warning reads “WARNING! TOBACCO USE CAUSES LUNG DISEASE.” Notably, all the warnings should be capitalised. It is complemented by a graphic portraying lungs that have not been subjected to tobacco use and those of a perennial smoker.
The third warning ought to be “WARNING! TOBACCO USE HARMS YOUR UNBORN BABY.” It is accompanied by a graphic of a pregnant woman smoking a cigarette.
The fourth warning must read “WARNING! TOBACCO USE CAUSES HEART DISEASE.” It features a graphic of a healthy heart and a smoker’s heart.
The fifth warning reads “WARNING! TOBACCO USE CAUSES INFERTILITY.” It is accompanied by a blurred-out image of a woman outside a fertility clinic, sulking over her inability to conceive.
Concurrently, the sixth warning states, “WARNING! TOBACCO USE CAUSES IMPOTENCE.” It features a graphic of a bent cigarette.
The seventh warning, also split into two, is centred around the risk of suffering from mouth cancer. The first section reads “WARNING! THIS PRODUCT IS NOT A SAFE ALTERNATIVE TO CIGARETTES.” It is followed by “WARNING! THIS PRODUCT CAN CAUSE MOUTH CANCER.” The warning is followed by a picture of one suffering from mouth cancer.
The eighth warning communicates that tobacco use can cause death. “WARNING! TOBACCO USE KILLS.” It is accompanied by an image of a coffin.
The addictive dangers of using tobacco products have been listed as the ninth warning, and it has been split into two as well. The first section reads, “WARNING! TOBACCO USE IS ADDICTIVE.” It features a graphic of a person chained to a vape product.
Meanwhile, the second part refers to the dangers of indulging in “smokeless” tobacco products, advising against using them as an alternative. It states, “WARNING! THIS PRODUCT IS NOT A SAFE ALTERNATIVE TO CIGARETTES.”

Another Kenyan Dies in Police Custody,"A stock theft suspect who had been held at the Katito Police Station in Kisumu has died while in police custody.
According to the station's police, the suspect died by suicide after he allegedly used his vest to hang himself on the cell door.
He had been arrested on suspicion of stealing goats and was held in solitary confinement. Police at the station said they were alerted to a commotion coming from the cell on June 13 at about 10:00 am.
Upon checking the source of the commotion, they realised the suspect had allegedly hanged himself.

His body was moved to the Nyando Morgue pending investigations.
This case comes barely two days after yet another suspect died by alleged suicide at the Ukwala police station in Siaya county on June 12.
The body of the 26-year-old was found hanging on a metal rod in the cells’ toilet, police said. He had been arrested following the issuance of a warrant by a court in the area.
The suspect had been accused of defilement. Police said he hanged himself in a toilet at the cells using his shirt.
According to the police at the Ukwala Police Station, the suspect was found hanging on a metal water pipe with his shirt around his neck.
These subsequent cases of alleged suicide in police stations follow the case of teacher and social media influencer Albert Ojwang, who police had initially alleged had died by suicide at the Central Police Station.
Police claimed Ojwang had self-inflicted injuries by hitting himself on the wall severally.
However, preliminary investigations by the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) and a government pathologist have disputed this claim, revealing that Ojwang died from head injuries, neck compression, and multiple bruises, suggesting blunt force trauma and strangulation.
These cases continue to raise questions about the safety of Kenyans in police custody, which is expected to be the safest place, yet is now turning out to be one of the most unsafe.

McDonald Mariga & Victor Wanyama Lose Mother,"Mildred Wanyama, the mother of Kenyan football legends Victor Wanyama and McDonald Mariga, is dead.
Through a statement released on Saturday, June 14, Mariga revealed the news of their mother’s passing, adding that she passed away in the early hours of Saturday.
He further added that burial arrangements were underway and that further details would be communicated soon.
“It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved mother, who left us peacefully today morning,” Mariga stated.

DAILY NATION
He added: “We are currently making arrangements and will share more details soon! Thank you.”
Mildred, a sporting icon herself, was married to Noah Wanyama, a former footballer who played for AFC Leopards. Together, they had five children: four boys and one girl. Their children include Mariga, Victor, Thomas and Sylvester Wanyama, who are all footballers, and Mercy Wanyama, a professional basketballer in Spain.
Mildred was a netball player in her youth. She met her husband, Noah, in the 1970s when they were both working for Kenya Railways and involved in sports.
She was known for being very supportive of her children's careers and expressed immense pride in their achievements.
Famously, she intervened when Mariga, her eldest son, considered joining the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) after Form Three, insisting he complete his secondary education. This decision was significant, as it later paved the way for his future success on the European football stage with Italian giants Inter Milan.
With Victor, she has been highlighted as crucial to nurturing the talents of a child who would later become the first Kenyan to play in the prestigious English Premier League (EPL).
Victor also ascended to the role of national team captain, leading the Harambee Stars in the 2019 African Cup of Nations, the first time Kenya featured in more than a decade.
Beyond motherhood, she was a trailblazer in women’s sports administration, holding senior leadership positions within netball.
Notably, she held the position of Kenya Netball Federation President from 2014 to 2018. 
Aside from that, she actively participated in community and family events, always projecting an image of strength and grace. Her presence at her children's significant milestones, both on and off the field, was a constant source of pride for the family.

Kenya Nominates DCI Boss Amin for INTERPOL Role,"Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen has nominated the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI)'s Director, Mohamed Amin, as Kenya’s candidate for election to the INTERPOL Executive Committee, representing the African region.
The move by the CS is aimed at amplifying Africa’s voice in global security matters.
The elections are set to take place during the 93rd session of the INTERPOL General Assembly, scheduled to take place in Marrakech, Morocco, from November 24 to 27.
Speaking on Friday during the 11th Regional Centre on Small Arms and Light Weapons (RECSA) Council in Nairobi, the Interior CS urged the members to support Amin’s candidacy, terming it a national milestone and a continental opportunity to shape global policing policy.

“Kenya’s win will provide an opportunity to champion Africa’s perspectives and priorities at the highest level of global policing,” Murkomen said during the RECSA meeting.
The INTERPOL Executive Committee is a governing body responsible for supervising the execution of decisions made by the General Assembly and overseeing the administration of INTERPOL’s General Secretariat.
Key responsibilities of the INTERPOL Executive Committee include supervising INTERPOL operations, setting agendas, overseeing the Secretary General, promoting international collaboration, and representing regional interests.
If elected, Amin would represent African nations within INTERPOL’s leadership, ensuring that Africa’s security concerns, such as cross-border crime, terrorism, and corruption, are prioritised in global policing strategies.
His role would involve liaising with African law enforcement agencies, advocating for capacity-building programmes, and ensuring effective crime-fighting measures across the continent.
With over 30 years in law enforcement, Amin brings deep experience in criminal investigations, counter-terrorism, and international cooperation.
The DCI boss has led high-profile investigations and testified at the ICC. He holds a Master’s in Criminology and has been decorated with top state honours, including EBS, MBS, and OGW.
As DCI Director, he also oversees INTERPOL's Eastern Africa bureau and has championed reforms in ethics, modernisation, and intelligence sharing. The DCI boss is widely respected for his integrity, leadership, and commitment to community-based policing.

Margaret Kenyatta Sends Message to Gen Zs,"Kenyan youth, particularly Gen Zs, were on Friday, June 13, urged to use their talents to build a better world and challenge the status quo.
While speaking to 170 graduating students at Brookhouse School's 17th graduation ceremony, former First Lady Margaret Kenyatta urged youth to be “architects of global change”, expressing her admiration for the new “bold” generation.
Further, she acknowledged the courage of Gen Zs in challenging the status quo, noting it was critical in ensuring global transformation and confronting injustices.
“You have learned to leverage your talents, not just for personal success, but to build a better world by contributing your gifts and brilliant minds to the world,” Margaret stated.

“I see a bold generation rising, one ready to question the status quo, reimagine the future, and confront injustices,” she said.
Margaret, who mostly stays away from the public limelight, noted that the brilliance of the youth must drive innovation, experiment with new ideas, and build a new world away from the chaos that is engulfing it.
“Go forth and shine. Wherever life takes you, let your light transform the world,” she asserted.
Her message follows former President Uhuru Kenyatta’s challenge to Gen Zs to continue fighting for their rights amidst various governance issues experienced during the tenure of his successor, William Ruto.
While speaking during the burial of his cousin, veteran rally driver Kibathi Muigai in January, Uhuru did not hide his thoughts on the rising influence of Kenyan youth on political discourse.
Uhuru, who has largely shied away from speaking on politics since he left office in 2022, asked the youth to continue fighting for their rights.
“The problem with people nowadays is that they are afraid. Gen Zs are the story of the future. Fight for your rights. Fight to ensure you are getting what is rightfully yours,” he urged.
He went on to add, “Don't stand and watch as your wealth is taken from you. Everything is worth fighting for. If you do not fight for it, don't cry if it is taken away.”
Uhuru was pleading with youths, including his daughter Ngina Kenyatta, to also join the fight, arguing it was time for him and his peers to rest and hand over the fight.

Obado Dealt Fresh Blow by EACC in Ongoing Wealth Probe,"Former Migori Governor Okoth Obado is set to lose assets worth Ksh428 million after the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) officially begins the auctioning process on June 23.
In 2024, Obado and the EACC struck a deal in which he surrendered several assets for the anti-graft body to drop cases on unexplained wealth against him, his children, and others.
The consent was recorded before High Court judge Esther Maina, where the EACC said they had settled the matter out of court and that it did not wish to pursue the two cases of Ksh1.9 billion and Ksh73 million involving unexplained wealth and proceeds of crime against Obado, his four children, businessman Jared Peter Oluoch Kwaga, and his firms.
“In that process, our and his lawyers met and they were able to agree in a process of negotiations where we agreed on the minimum amount we are to recover,” EACC CEO Abdi Ahmed Mohamoud revealed.

According to EACC, the auction process will officially begin on June 23, starting in Nairobi, then later extending to Kisumu and Migori, where more properties will be seized and auctioned.
The properties, believed to have been acquired through misappropriated public funds, will be auctioned, and the money returned to public projects.
Among the lush properties to be auctioned are luxurious residences in Nairobi, including a Ksh40 million Loresho Ridge house, a Ksh22 million apartment in Riara, two Greenspan maisonettes worth Ksh14.5 million, and an unfinished plot in Runda valued at Ksh50 million.
The Assets Recovery Agency (ARA) and EACC are leading the efforts to seize these assets. Initially, EACC had sought to recover the entire Ksh1.9 billion, but a negotiated agreement led to the surrender of properties worth Ksh428 million.
Mohamud revealed that the recovered funds will be deposited into Kenya’s Consolidated Fund, supporting public services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure development.
The commission hopes that such high-profile seizures will deter other public officials from engaging in corruption.
However, the EACC CEO raised concerns that while Kenyans report cases of graft involving politicians, when the commission begins the process of arrest and asset recovery, the same Kenyans rush to the defence of the accused.
“The moment we investigate, the same public that wanted action begins to shield the politician,” Mohamoud said.
This is among the many cases the commission is handling as it seeks to alleviate cases of graft among high-profile leaders in the country.

Fuel Tanker Explodes in Nakuru,"A massive fire erupted at Barnabas stage, Pipeline area, in Nakuru County, in the early hours of Saturday, June 14.
The fire is said to have broken out after a fuel tanker explosion caused multiple tankers to catch fire, with footage obtained by Kenyans.co.ke showing the blaze consuming the tankers.
Emergency response teams were seen on the ground battling to contain the blaze as it threatened to spread quickly to neighbouring areas.
While it remains unclear what led to the fuel tanker explosion, preliminary reports indicate that no casualties were reported.

As a result, the massive fire shut down the busy Nakuru–Nairobi Highway, caused significant disruptions, and rendered the highway impassable for hours.
Consequently, motorists were advised to avoid the area and seek alternative routes, as investigations to determine the main cause of the fire were said to have commenced.
Even so, the clips show curious onlookers milling around the scene of the fire, which appeared to have occurred within a contained area.
At the time of publishing, the police and the County Government of Nakuru had not released any official statement on the fire explosion.
The latest follows a recent night fire that broke out in the populous Kibra Estate in Nairobi that resulted in more than 100 families being forced to sleep in the cold.
Traders and homeowners bore the biggest brunt of the incident after the fire, which occurred on Wednesday, June 11, spread to their units, leaving them counting losses.
Residents reported that efforts to extinguish the fire were hampered by narrow roads, which prevented fire engines from accessing the scene.
Public Service CS Geoffrey Ruku, who visited the scene in the company of local leaders, including area MP Peter Orero, promised to release emergency aid to support them.
""Incidents of fires have become very common in informal settlements, especially in Nairobi. The government is committed to ending these tragedies to protect the lives and property of citizens,"" Ruku said.
""Early this morning, I visited Mukungu Village in Kibra, Nairobi, to support victims of a fire that left several families homeless. The government will provide emergency relief aid to the families to assist them in getting their lives back on track.""

"Kenya Met Warns of Strong Winds, Dangerous Waves in 15 Counties","In their latest weather advisory, the Kenya Meteorological Department has warned of strong winds and large waves that could lead to massive damage and marine disruption over the next six days.
The advisory, released on Friday, June 13, revealed that the strong winds could blow off roofs, uproot trees, and cause structural damage.
Also, the weatherman raised an alarm over the large waves, whose effects included lower visibility and disruption of marine activities.
The advisory listed the Coast, North-Eastern, North-Western, and South-Eastern lowlands as regions that would be most affected by the adverse weather conditions, which have a 33 to 66 per cent chance of occurring.

Key areas of concern were the counties of Lamu, Kilifi, Mombasa, Kwale, Tana River, Taita Taveta, Marsabit, Turkana, Samburu, Isiolo, Mandera, Wajir, Garissa, Kitui, and Makueni.
Kenya Met further warned residents in the affected areas to be on the lookout, noting that the weather conditions would begin on Friday, June 13, and last until Wednesday, June 18 at 10:00am.
While detailing the forecast, Kenya Met disclosed that strong southerly winds of more than 25 knots (12.9 m/s) would be experienced over the North-Eastern, North-Western, South-Eastern lowlands and Coastal regions of Kenya on Friday, June 13.
The winds are expected to strengthen to more than 30 knots (15.4 m/s) from Saturday, June 14, to Tuesday, June 17. Wind speeds are likely to reduce to 25 knots (12.9 m/s) on Wednesday, June 18.
Meanwhile, wave heights are likely to be more than 2.5 metres over the Kenya coastal waters on Friday, June 13.
The wave heights are expected to increase to 2.8 metres from Saturday, June 14, to Tuesday, June 17. They are expected to reduce to below 2.4 metres on Wednesday, June 18.
In the previous strong winds weather advisory, the County Government of Mombasa took drastic measures, closing public beaches for two days.
Aside from the closure of the beaches, the governor announced the suspension of ocean-based activities, both commercial and recreational. Consequently, activities such as fishing and water sports were suspended for a few days.

Over 300 Health Facilities in Nairobi Shut Down,"The Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Council (KMPDC) has closed down 728 health facilities across the country, including 394 in Nairobi, in a fresh crackdown on non-compliant facilities.
In collaboration with other health regulatory bodies and the county governments, KMPDC launched the crackdown in a bid to enforce the Inspections and Licensing Rules, 2022, aimed at improving patient safety and ensuring quality healthcare delivery.
According to an official statement by KMPDC, the crackdown has been ongoing since March, with phased inspections across both public and private health facilities in the different counties.
The inspection has already resulted in the scrutiny of 1,983 health facilities in several counties, including Mandera, Nairobi, Wajir, Kisii, and Nyamira.

Out of the 1,938 facilities examined, 728 were found to be severely non-compliant and subsequently shut down.
KMPDC closed 58, 394, 77, 120, and 79 facilities in Mandera, Nairobi, Wajir, Kisii, and Nyamira counties respectively.
In addition to the closures, 301 facilities were downgraded after failing to meet critical infrastructure and operational requirements, a measure intended to ensure that only facilities capable of delivering safe and quality healthcare continue to operate.
""These inspections are guided by The Inspections and Licensing Rules, 2022, developed under the Medical Practitioners and Dentists Act (CAP 253). The rules provide a robust framework for regulating healthcare facilities and ensuring compliance with ethical and professional standards,"" KMPDC's statement read in part.
The Medical Practitioners and Dentists Act (CAP 253) establishes a framework for registering, licensing, and regulating medical practitioners and dentists to ensure high professional and ethical standards in healthcare.
The rigorous inspections have also led to legal actions, with 31 individuals arrested for operating without valid licences and employing unregistered medical personnel.
KMPDU has emphasised the importance of inspections, noting that they are aimed at promoting accountability, transparency, and continuous improvement in healthcare delivery.
Defending the move, the council said that it is working to reduce the risk of medical errors, malpractice, and unsafe treatment environments.
“Our primary duty is to protect patients. We will continue to enforce these regulations firmly and fairly so that every Kenyan receives the quality healthcare they deserve,” a representative from KMPDC said.

Chaos in CBD After Hawkers Burn County Vehicle Near Afya Centre,"Chaos ensued in the Nairobi Central Business District on Friday, June 13, 2025, after angry hawkers burnt a Nairobi City County vehicle near Afya Centre.
Footage obtained by Kenyans.co.ke showed the vehicle overturned and in flames. Police officers were forced to fire teargas canisters to disperse the irate mob.
The chaos, happening at the heart of the city, unfolded after the hawkers and county askaris reportedly engaged in a standoff.
According to unconfirmed reports, the hawkers were frustrated by what they termed as harassment by the county authorities, leading to tensions and the subsequent chaos.

Details of whether the fracas led to injuries or claimed casualties are yet to be established, although preliminary reports indicate the situation did not descend into anarchy.
Confrontations between city county askaris, otherwise known as kanjo, and hawkers who, on most occasions, operate unlawfully within the city centre are common. However, most of the time, the scenario is characterised by running battles between the two groups, with hawkers aiming to avoid arrest.
Even so, the chaos comes just a day after violent protests were seen at the CBD over the demise of popular X influencer Albert Ojwang. 
In the protests, hundreds of youth stormed the streets on Thursday, June 12, demanding the resignation of Deputy Inspector General Eliud Lagat.
The protests threatened to cripple major operations within the CBD, as Kenyans awaited the reading of the 2025/2026 Budget by Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi.
Protesters marched through key areas including City Hall, Jeevanjee Gardens, and the Parliament Buildings.
They also occupied critical roads such as Harambee Avenue, signalling their intent to breach the security perimeter around Parliament.
Police responded by dispersing the crowds using tear gas canisters and other crowd-control tactics.
The protesters, some donned in Kenyan flag colours, sang in unison as they demanded the resignation of the DIG over the death of influencer Albert Ojwang while in police custody.
Additionally, images and videos obtained by Kenyans.co.ke showed them waving placards bearing messages directed at authorities, blowing whistles, and carrying twigs.

SHA New Payment Policy Triggers Public Outcry,"A wave of outrage is sweeping across the country as reports now emerge that, contrary to the normal monthly contributions, the Social Health Authority (SHA) is now demanding full-year payments before providing services.
This sudden shift without prior notice has sent Kenyans into utter shock and confusion, and worried about their access to healthcare.
Under the new approach, patients presenting at hospitals are being told that they must pay a lump sum for the SHA covering an entire year before receiving treatment.
According to Kenyans who took up the matter on their various social media pages, these contrasting changes have been witnessed since June.
Health CS Aden Duale during a meeting with the Development Partners in Health, Kenya (DPHK) on June 3, 2025. PHOTO MINISTRY OF HEALTH
""What is the problem with this SHA? I have tried to pay for my monthly contribution, which for the first two months I paid Ksh1,030 each. Now I am being asked to pay a yearly total of Ksh12,460. Has the system of payment changed? It appears SHA is for the haves and not the don't have,"" John Nalugala, one of the affected Kenyans, revealed on Facebook.
""I, together with many ailing Kenyans, visited one of our Level 4 hospitals. To our dismay, SHA wasn't able to serve us medically. The hospital claims we should pay for SHA services yearly and not the monthly contribution,"" Linda George, another Kenyan, shared her frustrations.
A spot check by Kenyans.co.ke also revealed that Kenyans have been facing this same problem, with those unable to make the full payment being asked to pay via the Hustler Fund loan, then repay the loan in instalments.
The situation, which is affecting Kenyans across all counties, is forcing patients to pay out of pocket or return home untreated, despite having previously made monthly contributions to the scheme.
Kenyans are facing this new challenge in a month when President William Ruto launched the 'lipa pole pole' model, where a mobile-based payment scheme was introduced to make SHA premiums more accessible, especially for Kenyans in the informal sector.
Under the new staggered payment plan, which took effect in June, self-employed Kenyans are now required to clear the annual subscription to SHA in lump sum through a Hustler Fund loan, scrapping the monthly contributions.
Kenyans are raising concerns that this is a way of forcefully shoving the loans into their already bleeding pockets.
Medical Services Principal Secretary Ouma Oluga told Nation Media that the Ministry is addressing the concerns. He urged affected Kenyans to collect all cases and keep a record of the occurrences.
SHA Chief Executive Officer Dr Mercy Mwangangi also told the media house that efforts are underway to look into the matter, promising swift action.
“I’m following up on this and on the system, after which I will give an update. But for now, kindly collect all these issues and share them with me,” she told the Nation.
Meanwhile, Kenyans who had been promised affordable health services are now facing frustrations and being locked out of essential services.

Ruto Calls Out Governor Kang’ata Over SHA,"President William Ruto has taken issue with Murang’a Governor Irungu Kang’ata over the county’s relatively low enrolment in the Social Health Authority (SHA) platform.
Speaking during the Murang’a Investment Forum held on Friday, June 13, the President cited statistics showing a disappointing uptake of the SHA scheme in the county, and announced plans to dispatch a team from SHA and the Ministry of Health to carry out sensitisation campaigns.
“Out of the 1.5 million people in Murang’a, only 283,000 have registered for the Social Health Authority (SHA) scheme,” Ruto revealed.
The statement was initially met with applause from attendees, seemingly unaware of the implications of the figures. Ruto, noting the misplaced reaction, went on to lay bare the reality on the ground.
Murang'a Governor Irungu Kang'ata addressed residents at a past event in the region. IRUNGU KANG'ATA
“You have clapped too soon. Murang’a is number 35 out of 47. You have registered only 27 per cent of Murang’a,” he noted.
“I want to encourage Murang’a. I will be sending the people from SHA and the (Health) Ministry to sensitise the people of Murang’a to work with the county government so that we can bring on board citizens,” Ruto asserted.
Ruto proceeded to issue a rallying call to the attendees over the benefits of SHA, noting it was a scheme that was aimed towards catering for Kenyans from all walks of life. 
However, a significant number of Murang’a residents benefit from Kang’ata Care, a social health initiative spearheaded by Governor Irungu Kang’ata. The scheme operates similarly to the SHA platform, aiming to deliver universal health coverage to vulnerable and low-income households within the county.
As of 2025, reports indicated that the programme was supporting approximately 40,000 households. Beneficiaries are selected through a comprehensive profiling and vetting process led by the county administration. This process often involves community health workers, chiefs, religious leaders, and medical officers to ensure that support reaches those most in need.
Although independently initiated, Kang’ata Care works in collaboration with the SHA, with the county government paying beneficiaries’ premiums quarterly in advance to guarantee uninterrupted coverage.
Meanwhile, Ruto’s message came just a week after he had ordered all governors to register all public health facilities under SHA.
Ruto, who spoke when he met the county chiefs on Thursday, June 5, said the move would be critical in ensuring the facilities get timely government reimbursements under the medical scheme.
The President said governors should issue directives and lay out Key Performance Indicators (KPI) to their County Executive Committee members (CECs) and County Chief Officers to ensure that they facilitate the registration of these health facilities.
According to the president, the unregistered facilities have played a key role in denying people quality healthcare under the medical scheme.

Central Police OCS Samson Talaam Arrested,"Central Police Station Officer Commanding Station Samson Talaam has been arrested in Eldoret over the murder of Albert Ojwang.
According to reports, police say he was on the run and has since been handed over to the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) for further questioning.
His lawyer Felix Kiprono confirmed the arrest and it followed IPOA confirming that the OCS was a person of interest in the case. Further, the Authority revealed that Ojwang died inside a Central Police Station jail cell.
His arrest comes after the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) boss Mohammed Amin had revealed that the OCS should be treated as a prime suspect in Ojwang's murder.

Speaking before the Senate, Amin identified Talaam as the individual most responsible for Ojwang's death, which occurred on Sunday, June 8.
While giving his brief to Senate, Amin clarified that Talaam had declined to book Ojwang upon his arrival in Central Police contrary to initial reports. 
“It has further been confirmed that before the booking, the report office personnel called the OCS, who declined to book the suspect. Talaam is the Officer Commanding Central Police Station,"" he stated.
""Talaam is the OCS of Central Police Station, and by the totality of things, he should be treated as the prime suspect in this matter,"" Amin noted.
However, in a quick rejoinder, Talaam denied being the prime suspect in the murder. While giving his account to IPOA, Talaam recounted that on the day of the popular influencer's death, he was brought into the station in critical condition.
According to his account, given on Wednesday, June 11, Talaam and fellow officers attempted to save his life. They even rushed the late Ojwang to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.
He further added that, contrary to reports, he did not object to Ojwang's booking at the station.
The OCS disclosed that he was not at the station when Ojwang was brought in but arrived after he was notified of Ojwang's critical state.
After news of Ojwang's murder broke and details of Central Police Station's role in the incident emerged, Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja interdicted Talaam and five others.
Aside from Talaam, other interdicted officers included the deputy OCS, the deputy non-commissioned officer, crime aid officer, cell sentry officer, and report office personnel.

Fresh Protests to Ruto's Office & Parliament Announced,"Families of fallen Gen Z victims during the June 25, 2024, protests have issued a formal notice to the Central Police Station, seeking permission to hold a peaceful procession in their honour.
Accompanied by notable activists, the families informed the police that they wish to organise peaceful marches on June 25, 2025, to the Office of the President and Parliament, in remembrance of the young people who died while protesting against the Finance Bill 2024.
According to the families, the planned protest is intended to be a peaceful procession.
Participants will gather to commemorate the lives lost during the demonstrations by laying flowers outside Parliament, where most of the victims died, as a symbolic gesture to honour their memory.

“Families of victims of comrades who were killed during GenZ protests last year are at Central Police Station to issue a notice to police for a peaceful march on 25th June 2025,” read a statement by Hussein Khalid, one of the activists who accompanied them to the station.
In addition to laying flowers and lighting candles, the families will also issue a memorandum for justice, a written statement outlining their grievances and demands.
The memorandum will highlight what went wrong during the protests, call for investigations into the events, demand accountability from those responsible, and propose concrete measures to prevent similar tragedies in future.
Among the families that visited Central Police Station to issue the notice were Gillian Munyao, the mother of Rex Masai, and other parents whose children were killed during the peaceful demonstrations in June 2024.
Activist Boniface Mwangi, who was present during the attempt to deliver the letter, claimed that officers at Central Police Station were refusing to accept the notice, urging Kenyans to show support.
“They’re there to notify police of the June 25, 2025 remembrance protest. Police are refusing to accept the letter. Media & solidarity needed,” Mwangi tweeted.
Several opposition leaders have called for June 25 to be declared a public holiday in honour of the fallen youths.
However, the government, through spokesperson Isaac Mwaura, dismissed the proposal, urging Kenyans to ignore the calls and go about their normal economic activities on that day.
“We have heard people say June 25 will be a public holiday. There is no public holiday on June 25. It is a working day if it falls on a weekday,"" Mwaura said.

Kenya Sends Message to UN Amidst Israel-Iran Conflict,"The Government of Kenya has broken its silence on the conflict between Israel and Iran, as reports of a potential war between the two countries continue to emerge.
In a statement, Foreign Affairs Principal Secretary Korir Sing’oei called for the restoration of peaceful relations between the two nations, following Israeli air strikes that killed senior Iranian military officials earlier today.
Sing’oei, speaking on Friday, June 13,  averred that the Kenyan government was keenly following the developments in the Middle East, noting they had voted in favour of the adoption of a resolution calling for a permanent ceasefire on the war in Gaza, in which Israel is involved. 
“We are following with deep concern the escalating situation in the Middle East that has the potential to spiral out of control with grievous implications for regional and global peace and security,” he stated.

“We urge Israel and Iran to exercise restraint and seek a peaceful resolution to the prevailing challenge that has triggered the current escalation in line with the Charter of the United Nations,” Sing’oei noted.
The PS also seemingly sent a cryptic message to the United Nations Security Council, which consists of Israeli allies such as the United States, calling for a unified approach in handling such matters.
“The conflict is a clear reason why we need a UNSC that functions and acts in the best interest of all,” Sing’oei noted.
The latest developments reflect growing international alarm over a potential Israeli strike on Iran, supported by a New York Times report from today indicating that U.S. and European officials believe Israel is preparing an imminent attack, prompting the evacuation of American military families from the region.
Recent estimates from the International Atomic Energy Agency, cited on the nuclear programme page of Iran, suggest that Iran could produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb within a week. This has intensified global pressure and reinforces Sing’oei’s call for UN Security Council reform to manage such crises effectively.
This comes amid reports that Iran might be planning a counterstrike, with United States President Donald Trump warning that far more lethal strikes on Iran are yet to come.
“I gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal. I told them, in the strongest of words, to 'just do it,' but no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldn't get it done.”
He added: “The United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the world, by far, and Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come and they know how to use it.”
The Israel-Iran conflict traces back to the 1979 Iranian Revolution, when Iran shifted from a nominal ally of Israel to a staunch adversary under its new Islamist government. Iran’s support for groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, and other proxies across the Middle East has long been a source of friction.
Israel, viewing Iran’s nuclear ambitions as an existential threat, has conducted covert operations, assassinations, cyberattacks (e.g. Stuxnet), and strikes on Iranian assets in Syria, while Iran has retaliated through proxies and occasional direct missile attacks.

KRA VAT Special Table Explained: What It Means for You as a Taxpayer,"In a move to cap VAT non-compliance, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has rolled out the new VAT Special Table, a compliance tool fully integrated into the iTax system.
The VAT Special Table serves as a monitoring mechanism designed to flag VAT-registered taxpayers who demonstrate specific patterns of non-compliance. Once flagged, these taxpayers are restricted from filing VAT returns through the iTax portal until the issues are resolved.
The primary goal of this tool is to enhance overall VAT compliance by ensuring that those who neglect their tax obligations face immediate restrictions, thereby encouraging them to return to compliance with the law.
According to KRA, five key categories of taxpayers have been identified as eligible to fall under the VAT Special Table. These are taxpayers who consistently file VAT returns but fail to make any payments for six consecutive months, even after debt recovery efforts. Exceptions are made for those with payment plans or who have made partial payments.

Tax Invoice Management System (TIMS) or eTIMS traders who fail to transition to TIMS/eTIMS as outlined in the VAT (Electronic Tax Invoice) Regulations, 2020, also fall into this category.
Taxpayers who have not filed any VAT return for six months or more, and traders who file nil returns for six months or more, yet input tax is being claimed using their PINs, are also eligible to fall into the VAT Special Table.
However, this does not include traders who file nil returns but have no input tax claims associated with them.
Lastly, taxpayers involved in VAT fraud, particularly those found to have claimed fictitious input tax or used fictitious credit notes, are also eligible to fall into the Special Table.
According to KRA, the VAT Special Table offers benefits for both taxpayers and the tax system. The Special Table helps to reduce PIN misuse by fraudsters, helps correct VAT obligations that are no longer applicable, and encourages compliant trade by helping businesses avoid risky suppliers.
If you are listed in the Special Table, the taxpayer’s return filing is blocked, and they will receive a message from KRA stating:
“This PIN is currently under review for VAT compliance irregularities. Please contact your respective KRA Tax Service Office (TSO),” the message will read.
KRA will then review the penalties internally. Input VAT claims will also be blocked; suppliers and trading partners will not be able to claim input VAT using your PIN until the issues are resolved. If the reason you’re flagged is failure to transition to eTIMS, you must visit your TSO for onboarding support.
If a taxpayer is flagged as a Payment Returns Without Payments (PRWP) but declared the transaction in their VAT return, the taxpayer’s trading partner can still apply to their TSO to have their input VAT claim approved, provided proper documentation is submitted as required under Section 17(2) of the VAT Act, 2013.
To get out of the Special VAT Table, contact your TSO immediately for help, regularise your tax obligations, and keep your proper documentation.

Court Gives Directive on Mukhwana in Ojwang Murder Case,"James Mukhwana, the prime suspect in the murder of Albert Ojwang, is set to remain in police custody and be detained at Capitol Hill Police Station as investigations into the murder continue.
In the latest development, Magistrate Robinson Ondieki at the Milimani Law Courts directed that Mukhwana be held for a week, pending the hearing of his case.
Ondieki set the hearing date for Friday, June 20, when he will deliver his ruling on whether Mukhwana will be released or remain in police custody.
“On whether he will remain in custody or be released, the date for the ruling has been set on the 20th of this month. In the meantime, he will be detained at the Capitol Hill Police Station,” the judge stated.

This comes after the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) requested that the suspect be detained for 21 days to allow for investigations.
Mukhwana was the first notable arrest in the murder of Ojwang, whose case has gained significant nationwide attention.
The officer, attached to the Central Police Station, was apprehended on Thursday, June 12.
“Please be informed that an officer of Central Police Station Nairobi, was arrested today, 12/06/2025 and placed in custody at Capitol Hill Police Station by officers from the Internal Affairs Unit (IAU) and the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA),” a memo released on the evening of Thursday, June 12 read. 
The arrest followed an extensive investigation by the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA), which revealed to the Administration and Internal Security Committee that an arrest announcement would be confirmed on Thursday. 
On Wednesday, IPOA released the names of six officers involved in the arrest of Ojwang’ from the Leaders Centre in Homa Bay County on Friday, June 7.
Notably, the arrested officer was not among the names released by Vice Chairperson Ann Mwangi before the Senate.
While it remains unclear whether the arrested officer was directly involved in Ojwang's killing, his apprehension was believed to be linked to glaring inconsistencies in how officers handled the situation when the late influencer was first brought to the station.
Ojwang was arrested at his home in Homa Bay County on Friday by DCI officers. The influencer was arrested on allegations of publishing false information, questioned on Saturday, and booked under OB number 136/7/6/2025 at 9:35 pm.

Petition Filed for Removal of DIG Lagat,"A petition seeking the removal of Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Eliud Lagat has been filed at the High Court.
The petition, filed on Friday, June 13, follows the arrest, alleged torture, and death of Albert Ojwang while in police custody at Central Police Station.
In an urgent application filed at the Milimani Law Courts, the petitioners, among them lawyer Ndegwa Njiru and Mt Kenya Jurists, are requesting that the matter be certified as urgent and heard on a priority and ex parte basis in the first instance.
They are also seeking conservatory orders restraining Lagat from accessing his office, performing the duties of DIG, or accessing any facility of the National Police Service, pending investigations by the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) and the commencement of prosecution against those responsible.

The petitioners argue that Lagat, being the initial complainant in the cybercrime case, should be considered a person of interest in the resulting death and that his continued presence in office poses a serious conflict of interest, which could lead to interference with investigations.
They cite reports of evidence tampering, including interference with CCTV footage, and allege a potential cover-up if he is not temporarily removed from office.
The petition comes amidst growing calls for DIG Lagat to resign, with many citing his alleged involvement in the murder as sufficient grounds.
Even so, the National Police Service (NPS) has maintained that Lagat is not compelled to resign from his post voluntarily, noting that only official intervention can necessitate his removal.
Appearing before the National Assembly Committee on National Security, Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja explained that the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) was currently conducting an independent investigation into the matter, and any further action against Lagat would depend on the outcome.
The IG clarified that if evidence implicated DIG Lagat in the ongoing probe, it would lead to action from the National Police Service. ""If the DIG is mentioned, he will step aside,"" he added.
On Wednesday, Kanja revealed details of the alleged posts that DIG Lagat had reported. He stated that the account, which had over 13,000 followers, had allegedly published false information accusing the DIG of involvement in corruption within the National Police Service.
Lagat was a notable absentee from the parliamentary proceedings on Thursday, although his counterpart, Deputy Inspector General Gilbert Masengeli, attended alongside DCI boss Mohamed Amin.
Meanwhile, several petitioners took matters into their own hands on Wednesday by filing a petition at the Milimani Law Courts, seeking to initiate private prosecution proceedings against Lagat.
In their petition, the petitioners criticised investigative agencies for failing to take appropriate action regarding the controversy surrounding the death of Ojwang.

Ruto Set to Make Changes in Govt,"Kenyans may witness major reshuffles in leadership after President William Ruto signed Executive Order One, the official reference document for the organisation of government.
Ruto's directive, as outlined by the Government Spokesperson Isaac Mwaura, drafts a blueprint for a more transparent, efficient, and citizen-centred administration.
""H.E. President William Ruto has signed Executive Order No. 1 of 2025, outlining the structure of the Government of Kenya. The Executive Order details Ministries, State Departments, and the roles under the Executive Office,"" the statement read in part.
Among the key changes outlined in the order is an updated Cabinet structure, signalling a possible reshuffle in the various ministries. The reorganisation is designed to streamline decision-making processes and create a more agile leadership framework.

The Executive Order also called for the complete overhaul of State Departments, suggesting the removal of redundancies, enhanced coordination, and improved overall efficiency in public service delivery.
One of the most significant aspects of the new directive is the creation of designated coordination roles under the Executive Office of the President. The Office has been expanded to include the Office of the Chief of Staff and Head of Public Service, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, Strategy Delivery Unit, President’s Delivery Unit, and the Presidential Economic Transformation Secretariat.
This move is intended to ensure seamless collaboration between different arms of government, particularly in implementing national policies and development programmes.
The reorganisation has also resulted in the creation of seven new State Departments with distinct mandates. The departments are: National Government Coordination; Science, Research and Innovation; Public Investments and Assets Management; and Special Programmes.
Others are: Aviation and Aerospace Development; Children’s Services; and the Department for Justice, Human Rights and Constitutional Affairs.
The Order has set in motion major changes, including delineating functions and coordinating responsibilities across Ministries and agencies.
With these highlights in place, Kenyans may see some Cabinet Secretaries (CSs) and Principal Secretaries (PSs) reassigned to align with the new directives. The President may also appoint more leaders to fill the newly proposed positions.
President Ruto, who is currently working closely with Raila Odinga through the broad-based government, may include more Raila allies in government as he continues to reward loyalists.
Mwaura has revealed that the Order seeks to realign the administration with the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA).
