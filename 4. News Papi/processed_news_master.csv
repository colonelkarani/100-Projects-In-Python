"Kenya Met Warns of Strong Winds, Dangerous Waves in 15 Counties","Urgent Kenya Met Alert: Destructive Winds, Deadly Waves Slam 15 Counties","In their latest weather advisory, the Kenya Meteorological Department has warned of strong winds and large waves that could lead to massive damage and marine disruption over the next six days.
The advisory, released on Friday, June 13, revealed that the strong winds could blow off roofs, uproot trees, and cause structural damage.
Also, the weatherman raised an alarm over the large waves, whose effects included lower visibility and disruption of marine activities.
The advisory listed the Coast, North-Eastern, North-Western, and South-Eastern lowlands as regions that would be most affected by the adverse weather conditions, which have a 33 to 66 per cent chance of occurring.

Key areas of concern were the counties of Lamu, Kilifi, Mombasa, Kwale, Tana River, Taita Taveta, Marsabit, Turkana, Samburu, Isiolo, Mandera, Wajir, Garissa, Kitui, and Makueni.
Kenya Met further warned residents in the affected areas to be on the lookout, noting that the weather conditions would begin on Friday, June 13, and last until Wednesday, June 18 at 10:00am.
While detailing the forecast, Kenya Met disclosed that strong southerly winds of more than 25 knots (12.9 m/s) would be experienced over the North-Eastern, North-Western, South-Eastern lowlands and Coastal regions of Kenya on Friday, June 13.
The winds are expected to strengthen to more than 30 knots (15.4 m/s) from Saturday, June 14, to Tuesday, June 17. Wind speeds are likely to reduce to 25 knots (12.9 m/s) on Wednesday, June 18.
Meanwhile, wave heights are likely to be more than 2.5 metres over the Kenya coastal waters on Friday, June 13.
The wave heights are expected to increase to 2.8 metres from Saturday, June 14, to Tuesday, June 17. They are expected to reduce to below 2.4 metres on Wednesday, June 18.
In the previous strong winds weather advisory, the County Government of Mombasa took drastic measures, closing public beaches for two days.
Aside from the closure of the beaches, the governor announced the suspension of ocean-based activities, both commercial and recreational. Consequently, activities such as fishing and water sports were suspended for a few days.

Over 300 Health Facilities in Nairobi Shut Down,300+ Nairobi Health Facilities Shut Down: Critical Update,"The Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Council (KMPDC) has closed down 728 health facilities across the country, including 394 in Nairobi, in a fresh crackdown on non-compliant facilities.
In collaboration with other health regulatory bodies and the county governments, KMPDC launched the crackdown in a bid to enforce the Inspections and Licensing Rules, 2022, aimed at improving patient safety and ensuring quality healthcare delivery.
According to an official statement by KMPDC, the crackdown has been ongoing since March, with phased inspections across both public and private health facilities in the different counties.
The inspection has already resulted in the scrutiny of 1,983 health facilities in several counties, including Mandera, Nairobi, Wajir, Kisii, and Nyamira.

Out of the 1,938 facilities examined, 728 were found to be severely non-compliant and subsequently shut down.
KMPDC closed 58, 394, 77, 120, and 79 facilities in Mandera, Nairobi, Wajir, Kisii, and Nyamira counties respectively.
In addition to the closures, 301 facilities were downgraded after failing to meet critical infrastructure and operational requirements, a measure intended to ensure that only facilities capable of delivering safe and quality healthcare continue to operate.
""These inspections are guided by The Inspections and Licensing Rules, 2022, developed under the Medical Practitioners and Dentists Act (CAP 253). The rules provide a robust framework for regulating healthcare facilities and ensuring compliance with ethical and professional standards,"" KMPDC's statement read in part.
The Medical Practitioners and Dentists Act (CAP 253) establishes a framework for registering, licensing, and regulating medical practitioners and dentists to ensure high professional and ethical standards in healthcare.
The rigorous inspections have also led to legal actions, with 31 individuals arrested for operating without valid licences and employing unregistered medical personnel.
KMPDU has emphasised the importance of inspections, noting that they are aimed at promoting accountability, transparency, and continuous improvement in healthcare delivery.
Defending the move, the council said that it is working to reduce the risk of medical errors, malpractice, and unsafe treatment environments.
“Our primary duty is to protect patients. We will continue to enforce these regulations firmly and fairly so that every Kenyan receives the quality healthcare they deserve,” a representative from KMPDC said.

Chaos in CBD After Hawkers Burn County Vehicle Near Afya Centre,CBD Chaos: Hawkers Torch County Vehicle at Afya Centre!,"Chaos ensued in the Nairobi Central Business District on Friday, June 13, 2025, after angry hawkers burnt a Nairobi City County vehicle near Afya Centre.
Footage obtained by Kenyans.co.ke showed the vehicle overturned and in flames. Police officers were forced to fire teargas canisters to disperse the irate mob.
The chaos, happening at the heart of the city, unfolded after the hawkers and county askaris reportedly engaged in a standoff.
According to unconfirmed reports, the hawkers were frustrated by what they termed as harassment by the county authorities, leading to tensions and the subsequent chaos.

Details of whether the fracas led to injuries or claimed casualties are yet to be established, although preliminary reports indicate the situation did not descend into anarchy.
Confrontations between city county askaris, otherwise known as kanjo, and hawkers who, on most occasions, operate unlawfully within the city centre are common. However, most of the time, the scenario is characterised by running battles between the two groups, with hawkers aiming to avoid arrest.
Even so, the chaos comes just a day after violent protests were seen at the CBD over the demise of popular X influencer Albert Ojwang. 
In the protests, hundreds of youth stormed the streets on Thursday, June 12, demanding the resignation of Deputy Inspector General Eliud Lagat.
The protests threatened to cripple major operations within the CBD, as Kenyans awaited the reading of the 2025/2026 Budget by Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi.
Protesters marched through key areas including City Hall, Jeevanjee Gardens, and the Parliament Buildings.
They also occupied critical roads such as Harambee Avenue, signalling their intent to breach the security perimeter around Parliament.
Police responded by dispersing the crowds using tear gas canisters and other crowd-control tactics.
The protesters, some donned in Kenyan flag colours, sang in unison as they demanded the resignation of the DIG over the death of influencer Albert Ojwang while in police custody.
Additionally, images and videos obtained by Kenyans.co.ke showed them waving placards bearing messages directed at authorities, blowing whistles, and carrying twigs.

SHA New Payment Policy Triggers Public Outcry,SHA's New Payment Policy Sparks Public Outrage,"A wave of outrage is sweeping across the country as reports now emerge that, contrary to the normal monthly contributions, the Social Health Authority (SHA) is now demanding full-year payments before providing services.
This sudden shift without prior notice has sent Kenyans into utter shock and confusion, and worried about their access to healthcare.
Under the new approach, patients presenting at hospitals are being told that they must pay a lump sum for the SHA covering an entire year before receiving treatment.
According to Kenyans who took up the matter on their various social media pages, these contrasting changes have been witnessed since June.

""What is the problem with this SHA? I have tried to pay for my monthly contribution, which for the first two months I paid Ksh1,030 each. Now I am being asked to pay a yearly total of Ksh12,460. Has the system of payment changed? It appears SHA is for the haves and not the don't have,"" John Nalugala, one of the affected Kenyans, revealed on Facebook.
""I, together with many ailing Kenyans, visited one of our Level 4 hospitals. To our dismay, SHA wasn't able to serve us medically. The hospital claims we should pay for SHA services yearly and not the monthly contribution,"" Linda George, another Kenyan, shared her frustrations.
A spot check by Kenyans.co.ke also revealed that Kenyans have been facing this same problem, with those unable to make the full payment being asked to pay via the Hustler Fund loan, then repay the loan in instalments.
The situation, which is affecting Kenyans across all counties, is forcing patients to pay out of pocket or return home untreated, despite having previously made monthly contributions to the scheme.
Kenyans are facing this new challenge in a month when President William Ruto launched the 'lipa pole pole' model, where a mobile-based payment scheme was introduced to make SHA premiums more accessible, especially for Kenyans in the informal sector.
Under the new staggered payment plan, which took effect in June, self-employed Kenyans are now required to clear the annual subscription to SHA in lump sum through a Hustler Fund loan, scrapping the monthly contributions.
Kenyans are raising concerns that this is a way of forcefully shoving the loans into their already bleeding pockets.
Medical Services Principal Secretary Ouma Oluga told Nation Media that the Ministry is addressing the concerns. He urged affected Kenyans to collect all cases and keep a record of the occurrences.
SHA Chief Executive Officer Dr Mercy Mwangangi also told the media house that efforts are underway to look into the matter, promising swift action.
“I’m following up on this and on the system, after which I will give an update. But for now, kindly collect all these issues and share them with me,” she told the Nation.
Meanwhile, Kenyans who had been promised affordable health services are now facing frustrations and being locked out of essential services.

This abrupt policy shift, implemented without warning since June, blocks essential medical services unless patients pay hefty lump sums, forcing many to resort to loans or go untreated – directly contradicting a new 'pay slowly' government initiative. Public outrage is mounting as citizens previously contributing monthly now find themselves locked out of care they expected to access.","`Photorealistic image of Kenyans clustered outside a brightly painted public health clinic under harsh sunlight.

Ruto Calls Out Governor Kang’ata Over SHA,Ruto Blasts Governor Kang’ata Over SHA Standoff!,"President William Ruto has taken issue with Murang’a Governor Irungu Kang’ata over the county’s relatively low enrolment in the Social Health Authority (SHA) platform.
Speaking during the Murang’a Investment Forum held on Friday, June 13, the President cited statistics showing a disappointing uptake of the SHA scheme in the county, and announced plans to dispatch a team from SHA and the Ministry of Health to carry out sensitisation campaigns.
“Out of the 1.5 million people in Murang’a, only 283,000 have registered for the Social Health Authority (SHA) scheme,” Ruto revealed.
The statement was initially met with applause from attendees, seemingly unaware of the implications of the figures. Ruto, noting the misplaced reaction, went on to lay bare the reality on the ground.
Murang'a Governor Irungu Kang'ata addressed residents at a past event in the region. IRUNGU KANG'ATA
“You have clapped too soon. Murang’a is number 35 out of 47. You have registered only 27 per cent of Murang’a,” he noted.
“I want to encourage Murang’a. I will be sending the people from SHA and the (Health) Ministry to sensitise the people of Murang’a to work with the county government so that we can bring on board citizens,” Ruto asserted.
Ruto proceeded to issue a rallying call to the attendees over the benefits of SHA, noting it was a scheme that was aimed towards catering for Kenyans from all walks of life. 
However, a significant number of Murang’a residents benefit from Kang’ata Care, a social health initiative spearheaded by Governor Irungu Kang’ata. The scheme operates similarly to the SHA platform, aiming to deliver universal health coverage to vulnerable and low-income households within the county.
As of 2025, reports indicated that the programme was supporting approximately 40,000 households. Beneficiaries are selected through a comprehensive profiling and vetting process led by the county administration. This process often involves community health workers, chiefs, religious leaders, and medical officers to ensure that support reaches those most in need.
Although independently initiated, Kang’ata Care works in collaboration with the SHA, with the county government paying beneficiaries’ premiums quarterly in advance to guarantee uninterrupted coverage.
Meanwhile, Ruto’s message came just a week after he had ordered all governors to register all public health facilities under SHA.
Ruto, who spoke when he met the county chiefs on Thursday, June 5, said the move would be critical in ensuring the facilities get timely government reimbursements under the medical scheme.
The President said governors should issue directives and lay out Key Performance Indicators (KPI) to their County Executive Committee members (CECs) and County Chief Officers to ensure that they facilitate the registration of these health facilities.
According to the president, the unregistered facilities have played a key role in denying people quality healthcare under the medical scheme.

Central Police OCS Samson Talaam Arrested,Breaking: Top Cop Samson Talaam Arrested at Central Police Station,"Central Police Station Officer Commanding Station Samson Talaam has been arrested in Eldoret over the murder of Albert Ojwang.
According to reports, police say he was on the run and has since been handed over to the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) for further questioning.
His lawyer Felix Kiprono confirmed the arrest and it followed IPOA confirming that the OCS was a person of interest in the case. Further, the Authority revealed that Ojwang died inside a Central Police Station jail cell.
His arrest comes after the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) boss Mohammed Amin had revealed that the OCS should be treated as a prime suspect in Ojwang's murder.

Speaking before the Senate, Amin identified Talaam as the individual most responsible for Ojwang's death, which occurred on Sunday, June 8.
While giving his brief to Senate, Amin clarified that Talaam had declined to book Ojwang upon his arrival in Central Police contrary to initial reports. 
“It has further been confirmed that before the booking, the report office personnel called the OCS, who declined to book the suspect. Talaam is the Officer Commanding Central Police Station,"" he stated.
""Talaam is the OCS of Central Police Station, and by the totality of things, he should be treated as the prime suspect in this matter,"" Amin noted.
However, in a quick rejoinder, Talaam denied being the prime suspect in the murder. While giving his account to IPOA, Talaam recounted that on the day of the popular influencer's death, he was brought into the station in critical condition.
According to his account, given on Wednesday, June 11, Talaam and fellow officers attempted to save his life. They even rushed the late Ojwang to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.
He further added that, contrary to reports, he did not object to Ojwang's booking at the station.
The OCS disclosed that he was not at the station when Ojwang was brought in but arrived after he was notified of Ojwang's critical state.
After news of Ojwang's murder broke and details of Central Police Station's role in the incident emerged, Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja interdicted Talaam and five others.
Aside from Talaam, other interdicted officers included the deputy OCS, the deputy non-commissioned officer, crime aid officer, cell sentry officer, and report office personnel.

Accompanied by notable activists, the families informed the police that they wish to organise peaceful marches on June 25, 2025, to the Office of the President and Parliament, in remembrance of the young people who died while protesting against the Finance Bill 2024.
According to the families, the planned protest is intended to be a peaceful procession.
Participants will gather to commemorate the lives lost during the demonstrations by laying flowers outside Parliament, where most of the victims died, as a symbolic gesture to honour their memory.

“Families of victims of comrades who were killed during GenZ protests last year are at Central Police Station to issue a notice to police for a peaceful march on 25th June 2025,” read a statement by Hussein Khalid, one of the activists who accompanied them to the station.
In addition to laying flowers and lighting candles, the families will also issue a memorandum for justice, a written statement outlining their grievances and demands.
The memorandum will highlight what went wrong during the protests, call for investigations into the events, demand accountability from those responsible, and propose concrete measures to prevent similar tragedies in future.
Among the families that visited Central Police Station to issue the notice were Gillian Munyao, the mother of Rex Masai, and other parents whose children were killed during the peaceful demonstrations in June 2024.
Activist Boniface Mwangi, who was present during the attempt to deliver the letter, claimed that officers at Central Police Station were refusing to accept the notice, urging Kenyans to show support.
“They’re there to notify police of the June 25, 2025 remembrance protest. Police are refusing to accept the letter. Media & solidarity needed,” Mwangi tweeted.
Several opposition leaders have called for June 25 to be declared a public holiday in honour of the fallen youths.
However, the government, through spokesperson Isaac Mwaura, dismissed the proposal, urging Kenyans to ignore the calls and go about their normal economic activities on that day.
“We have heard people say June 25 will be a public holiday. There is no public holiday on June 25. It is a working day if it falls on a weekday,"" Mwaura said.

They want an image prompt for AI image generation based on the news article provided. The image should visually represent the story without any text, include Kenyan context where appropriate, and be engaging and relatable.

First, I need to understand the key elements of the news story. The main points are: grieving families of young protesters killed in 2024 Finance Bill clashes are requesting police permission to march on June 25th. The plan includes a solemn gathering with flowers and a candlelight vigil outside Parliament. The authorities are refusing their notice and not declaring it a holiday. The protests are targeting Ruto's office and Parliament.

Now, translating this into a visual scene. The setting should be in Kenya, specifically outside Parliament in Nairobi. Including Kenyan flags or elements like the Parliament building would add context. The time of day might be evening or sunset to enhance the solemn mood, with candlelight vigil adding a warm glow.

The participants are grieving families, so they should be diverse in age, with children and elderly. They should be holding flowers and candles. Maybe a sense of unity and determination in their expressions. The atmosphere should be peaceful but resolute, contrasting with the funereal setting.

Including the Parliament building in the background makes sense. Maybe some police presence showing the authorities' resistance to allowing the march, like barriers or police vehicles. The refusal of their notice could be represented by a rejected permit notice (but no text, so maybe just a backdrop with symbolic elements like a crossed-out sign).

Kenya Sends Message to UN Amidst Israel-Iran Conflict,Kenya Sends Message to UN Amidst Israel-Iran Conflict,"The Government of Kenya has broken its silence on the conflict between Israel and Iran, as reports of a potential war between the two countries continue to emerge.
In a statement, Foreign Affairs Principal Secretary Korir Sing’oei called for the restoration of peaceful relations between the two nations, following Israeli air strikes that killed senior Iranian military officials earlier today.
Sing’oei, speaking on Friday, June 13,  averred that the Kenyan government was keenly following the developments in the Middle East, noting they had voted in favour of the adoption of a resolution calling for a permanent ceasefire on the war in Gaza, in which Israel is involved. 
“We are following with deep concern the escalating situation in the Middle East that has the potential to spiral out of control with grievous implications for regional and global peace and security,” he stated.
President William Ruto speaking during the Leader-Level Meeting of the Economic and Social Council Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti at the United Nations Headquarters, New York on September 23, 2024. PCS
“We urge Israel and Iran to exercise restraint and seek a peaceful resolution to the prevailing challenge that has triggered the current escalation in line with the Charter of the United Nations,” Sing’oei noted.
The PS also seemingly sent a cryptic message to the United Nations Security Council, which consists of Israeli allies such as the United States, calling for a unified approach in handling such matters.
“The conflict is a clear reason why we need a UNSC that functions and acts in the best interest of all,” Sing’oei noted.
The latest developments reflect growing international alarm over a potential Israeli strike on Iran, supported by a New York Times report from today indicating that U.S. and European officials believe Israel is preparing an imminent attack, prompting the evacuation of American military families from the region.
Recent estimates from the International Atomic Energy Agency, cited on the nuclear programme page of Iran, suggest that Iran could produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb within a week. This has intensified global pressure and reinforces Sing’oei’s call for UN Security Council reform to manage such crises effectively.
This comes amid reports that Iran might be planning a counterstrike, with United States President Donald Trump warning that far more lethal strikes on Iran are yet to come.
“I gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal. I told them, in the strongest of words, to 'just do it,' but no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldn't get it done.”
He added: “The United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the world, by far, and Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come and they know how to use it.”
The Israel-Iran conflict traces back to the 1979 Iranian Revolution, when Iran shifted from a nominal ally of Israel to a staunch adversary under its new Islamist government. Iran’s support for groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, and other proxies across the Middle East has long been a source of friction.
Israel, viewing Iran’s nuclear ambitions as an existential threat, has conducted covert operations, assassinations, cyberattacks (e.g. Stuxnet), and strikes on Iranian assets in Syria, while Iran has retaliated through proxies and occasional direct missile attacks.

“We urge Israel and Iran to exercise restraint and seek a peaceful resolution to the prevailing challenge that has triggered the current escalation in line with the Charter of the United Nations,” Sing’oei noted.
The PS also seemingly sent a cryptic message to the United Nations Security Council, which consists of Israeli allies such as the United States, calling for a unified approach in handling such matters.
“The conflict is a clear reason why we need a UNSC that functions and acts in the best interest of all,” Sing’oei noted.
The latest developments reflect growing international alarm over a potential Israeli strike on Iran, supported by a New York Times report from today indicating that U.S. and European officials believe Israel is preparing an imminent attack, prompting the evacuation of American military families from the region.
Recent estimates from the International Atomic Energy Agency, cited on the nuclear programme page of Iran, suggest that Iran could produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb within a week. This has intensified global pressure and reinforces Sing’oei’s call for UN Security Council reform to manage such crises effectively.
This comes amid reports that Iran might be planning a counterstrike, with United States President Donald Trump warning that far more lethal strikes on Iran are yet to come.
“I gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal. I told them, in the strongest of words, to 'just do it,' but no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldn't get it done.”
He added: “The United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the world, by far, and Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come and they know how to use it.”
The Israel-Iran conflict traces back to the 1979 Iranian Revolution, when Iran shifted from a nominal ally of Israel to a staunch adversary under its new Islamist government. Iran’s support for groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, and other proxies across the Middle East has long been a source of friction.
Israel, viewing Iran’s nuclear ambitions as an existential threat, has conducted covert operations, assassinations, cyberattacks (e.g. Stuxnet), and strikes on Iranian assets in Syria, while Iran has retaliated through proxies and occasional direct missile attacks.

KRA VAT Special Table Explained: What It Means for You as a Taxpayer,KRA VAT Special Table Explained: What It Means for You as a Taxpayer,"In a move to cap VAT non-compliance, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has rolled out the new VAT Special Table, a compliance tool fully integrated into the iTax system.
The VAT Special Table serves as a monitoring mechanism designed to flag VAT-registered taxpayers who demonstrate specific patterns of non-compliance. Once flagged, these taxpayers are restricted from filing VAT returns through the iTax portal until the issues are resolved.
The primary goal of this tool is to enhance overall VAT compliance by ensuring that those who neglect their tax obligations face immediate restrictions, thereby encouraging them to return to compliance with the law.
According to KRA, five key categories of taxpayers have been identified as eligible to fall under the VAT Special Table. These are taxpayers who consistently file VAT returns but fail to make any payments for six consecutive months, even after debt recovery efforts. Exceptions are made for those with payment plans or who have made partial payments.
A graphic showing taxes and the Kenyan flag in the background. PHOTO CANVA
Tax Invoice Management System (TIMS) or eTIMS traders who fail to transition to TIMS/eTIMS as outlined in the VAT (Electronic Tax Invoice) Regulations, 2020, also fall into this category.
Taxpayers who have not filed any VAT return for six months or more, and traders who file nil returns for six months or more, yet input tax is being claimed using their PINs, are also eligible to fall into the VAT Special Table.
However, this does not include traders who file nil returns but have no input tax claims associated with them.
Lastly, taxpayers involved in VAT fraud, particularly those found to have claimed fictitious input tax or used fictitious credit notes, are also eligible to fall into the Special Table.
According to KRA, the VAT Special Table offers benefits for both taxpayers and the tax system. The Special Table helps to reduce PIN misuse by fraudsters, helps correct VAT obligations that are no longer applicable, and encourages compliant trade by helping businesses avoid risky suppliers.
If you are listed in the Special Table, the taxpayer’s return filing is blocked, and they will receive a message from KRA stating:
“This PIN is currently under review for VAT compliance irregularities. Please contact your respective KRA Tax Service Office (TSO),” the message will read.
KRA will then review the penalties internally. Input VAT claims will also be blocked; suppliers and trading partners will not be able to claim input VAT using your PIN until the issues are resolved. If the reason you’re flagged is failure to transition to eTIMS, you must visit your TSO for onboarding support.
If a taxpayer is flagged as a Payment Returns Without Payments (PRWP) but declared the transaction in their VAT return, the taxpayer’s trading partner can still apply to their TSO to have their input VAT claim approved, provided proper documentation is submitted as required under Section 17(2) of the VAT Act, 2013.
To get out of the Special VAT Table, contact your TSO immediately for help, regularise your tax obligations, and keep your proper documentation.

Court Gives Directive on Mukhwana in Ojwang Murder Case,Court Gives Directive on Mukhwana in Ojwang Murder Case,"James Mukhwana, the prime suspect in the murder of Albert Ojwang, is set to remain in police custody and be detained at Capitol Hill Police Station as investigations into the murder continue.
In the latest development, Magistrate Robinson Ondieki at the Milimani Law Courts directed that Mukhwana be held for a week, pending the hearing of his case.
Ondieki set the hearing date for Friday, June 20, when he will deliver his ruling on whether Mukhwana will be released or remain in police custody.
“On whether he will remain in custody or be released, the date for the ruling has been set on the 20th of this month. In the meantime, he will be detained at the Capitol Hill Police Station,” the judge stated.

This comes after the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) requested that the suspect be detained for 21 days to allow for investigations.
Mukhwana was the first notable arrest in the murder of Ojwang, whose case has gained significant nationwide attention.
The officer, attached to the Central Police Station, was apprehended on Thursday, June 12.
“Please be informed that an officer of Central Police Station Nairobi, was arrested today, 12/06/2025 and placed in custody at Capitol Hill Police Station by officers from the Internal Affairs Unit (IAU) and the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA),” a memo released on the evening of Thursday, June 12 read. 
The arrest followed an extensive investigation by the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA), which revealed to the Administration and Internal Security Committee that an arrest announcement would be confirmed on Thursday. 
On Wednesday, IPOA released the names of six officers involved in the arrest of Ojwang’ from the Leaders Centre in Homa Bay County on Friday, June 7.
Notably, the arrested officer was not among the names released by Vice Chairperson Ann Mwangi before the Senate.
While it remains unclear whether the arrested officer was directly involved in Ojwang's killing, his apprehension was believed to be linked to glaring inconsistencies in how officers handled the situation when the late influencer was first brought to the station.
Ojwang was arrested at his home in Homa Bay County on Friday by DCI officers. The influencer was arrested on allegations of publishing false information, questioned on Saturday, and booked under OB number 136/7/6/2025 at 9:35 pm.

Petition Filed for Removal of DIG Lagat,Petition Filed for Removal of DIG Lagat,"A petition seeking the removal of Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Eliud Lagat has been filed at the High Court.
The petition, filed on Friday, June 13, follows the arrest, alleged torture, and death of Albert Ojwang while in police custody at Central Police Station.
In an urgent application filed at the Milimani Law Courts, the petitioners, among them lawyer Ndegwa Njiru and Mt Kenya Jurists, are requesting that the matter be certified as urgent and heard on a priority and ex parte basis in the first instance.
They are also seeking conservatory orders restraining Lagat from accessing his office, performing the duties of DIG, or accessing any facility of the National Police Service, pending investigations by the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) and the commencement of prosecution against those responsible.
Deputy Inspector General of Police Eliud Lagat giving a speech on March 25, 2025 TWITTER NPS
The petitioners argue that Lagat, being the initial complainant in the cybercrime case, should be considered a person of interest in the resulting death and that his continued presence in office poses a serious conflict of interest, which could lead to interference with investigations.
They cite reports of evidence tampering, including interference with CCTV footage, and allege a potential cover-up if he is not temporarily removed from office.
The petition comes amidst growing calls for DIG Lagat to resign, with many citing his alleged involvement in the murder as sufficient grounds.
Even so, the National Police Service (NPS) has maintained that Lagat is not compelled to resign from his post voluntarily, noting that only official intervention can necessitate his removal.
Appearing before the National Assembly Committee on National Security, Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja explained that the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) was currently conducting an independent investigation into the matter, and any further action against Lagat would depend on the outcome.
The IG clarified that if evidence implicated DIG Lagat in the ongoing probe, it would lead to action from the National Police Service. ""If the DIG is mentioned, he will step aside,"" he added.
On Wednesday, Kanja revealed details of the alleged posts that DIG Lagat had reported. He stated that the account, which had over 13,000 followers, had allegedly published false information accusing the DIG of involvement in corruption within the National Police Service.
Lagat was a notable absentee from the parliamentary proceedings on Thursday, although his counterpart, Deputy Inspector General Gilbert Masengeli, attended alongside DCI boss Mohamed Amin.
Meanwhile, several petitioners took matters into their own hands on Wednesday by filing a petition at the Milimani Law Courts, seeking to initiate private prosecution proceedings against Lagat.
In their petition, the petitioners criticised investigative agencies for failing to take appropriate action regarding the controversy surrounding the death of Ojwang.

Ruto Set to Make Changes in Govt,Ruto Set to Make Changes in Govt,"Kenyans may witness major reshuffles in leadership after President William Ruto signed Executive Order One, the official reference document for the organisation of government.
Ruto's directive, as outlined by the Government Spokesperson Isaac Mwaura, drafts a blueprint for a more transparent, efficient, and citizen-centred administration.
""H.E. President William Ruto has signed Executive Order No. 1 of 2025, outlining the structure of the Government of Kenya. The Executive Order details Ministries, State Departments, and the roles under the Executive Office,"" the statement read in part.
Among the key changes outlined in the order is an updated Cabinet structure, signalling a possible reshuffle in the various ministries. The reorganisation is designed to streamline decision-making processes and create a more agile leadership framework.
President William Ruto addresses 50 newly appointed CASs at State House on March 23, 2023.
WILLIAM RUTO
The Executive Order also called for the complete overhaul of State Departments, suggesting the removal of redundancies, enhanced coordination, and improved overall efficiency in public service delivery.
One of the most significant aspects of the new directive is the creation of designated coordination roles under the Executive Office of the President. The Office has been expanded to include the Office of the Chief of Staff and Head of Public Service, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, Strategy Delivery Unit, President’s Delivery Unit, and the Presidential Economic Transformation Secretariat.
This move is intended to ensure seamless collaboration between different arms of government, particularly in implementing national policies and development programmes.
The reorganisation has also resulted in the creation of seven new State Departments with distinct mandates. The departments are: National Government Coordination; Science, Research and Innovation; Public Investments and Assets Management; and Special Programmes.
Others are: Aviation and Aerospace Development; Children’s Services; and the Department for Justice, Human Rights and Constitutional Affairs.
The Order has set in motion major changes, including delineating functions and coordinating responsibilities across Ministries and agencies.
With these highlights in place, Kenyans may see some Cabinet Secretaries (CSs) and Principal Secretaries (PSs) reassigned to align with the new directives. The President may also appoint more leaders to fill the newly proposed positions.
President Ruto, who is currently working closely with Raila Odinga through the broad-based government, may include more Raila allies in government as he continues to reward loyalists.
Mwaura has revealed that the Order seeks to realign the administration with the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA).

Details Emerge on Man Accused of Deleting CCTV Footage at Central Police Station,Details Emerge on Man Accused of Deleting CCTV Footage at Central Police Station,"A CCTV technician believed to be responsible for tampering with crucial footage linked to the death of Albert Ojwang has allegedly been arrested by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI).
The man is said to have been arrested on the morning of Friday, June 13, in a supposed targeted operation at his residence in a populous Nairobi estate.
According to sources privy to the situation, the technician, who had overseen the installation of all 25 cameras at the station in 2024, was called just past 6:00 am on Saturday, June 8, by a police officer at Central Police Station. Aside from the cameras, the man also installed a digital video recorder (DVR) where all captured footage is stored.
The man claims that the officer urged him to report to the station immediately. Upon arrival, he was taken to the office of a senior officer, where the DVR is housed and was allegedly asked to delete footage from Thursday, June 6, and Friday, June 7.

However, it is reported he informed the officers that specific-day deletion was not possible, and the only option was to format the hard drive, which would erase all stored data and restore default settings.
He added that he did not remove anything from the DVR and was given Ksh3,000 by a senior officer after the task.
The latest comes after the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) confirmed that CCTV footage at the station had been tampered with.
IPOA's Deputy Chairperson, Ann Wanjiku, made the revelation on Wednesday, June 11, while appearing before the Senate, where she was grilled on findings from the authority on Ojwang's death.
While confirming that IPOA learnt about Ojwang's death through the media, the deputy chairperson revealed that investigations were immediately launched, which uncovered several inconsistencies in the National Police Service's initial version of events.
""The key findings were that the CCTV systems located at the OCS's office had been interfered with,"" she said.
Ojwang was arrested at his home in Homa Bay County on Friday by DCI officers. The influencer was arrested on allegations of publishing false information, questioned on Saturday, and booked under OB number 136/7/6/2025 at 9:35 pm. 
According to Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja, after investigations, Ojwang, who was a teacher by profession, was later transferred to a holding unit within the station where he was locked up.
However, during routine checks by officers on duty, police later discovered that Ojwang was unconscious in his cell. He was taken to Mbagathi Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival on Sunday, June 8.
A statement by the police claimed that Ojwang's death was by suicide, stating he had hit himself on the wall several times.

However, when the autopsy report by pathologists finally came out, it was confirmed that the late Ojwang died from head injuries, neck compression and multiple soft tissue trauma. This ruled out self-inflicted wounds, as initially suggested by the NPS.

Omtatah Flags Transfer of Ksh 192M Kenya Pipeline Project to Nigerian Firm,Omtatah Flags Transfer of Ksh 192M Kenya Pipeline Project to Nigerian Firm,"Busia Senator Okiya Omtatah has raised the alarm over the transfer of a Kenya Pipeline project worth Ksh192 million to a private firm, citing three major constitutional violations.
Through a statement released on Friday, June 13, Omtatah referenced a post where he had sought a statement regarding the transfer of the project, expressing his rejection of the response he received from the Energy Ministry on the matter.
“I have rejected the Ministry of Energy’s response regarding the controversial handover of the Kenya Pipeline Company LPG project to a private firm. The reply was shallow and reflected a contemptuous disregard for the Constitution and the laws that protect public assets,” Murkomen stated.
“The Ministry ignored the Public Finance Management Act, the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act, and the Companies Act, under which the Kenya Pipeline Company is registered. These laws are not optional. They are the foundation of accountability in a democracy,” he added.

According to Omtatah, KPC had invested Ksh 192M in preparatory work, including demand surveys, environmental and social impact assessments, engineering designs, but argued the project was undermined when the project was transferred without due process.
As per Omtatah, violation of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), which advocates for prudent management of public funds, occurred after the project was handed over after much significant investment without a clear, legally compliant process. Such could violate Sections 68 and 73 of the PFMA, which require accountability and value for money in public expenditure.
The Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act could have been violated in the selection of the Nigerian firm as the new custodian of the project. Omtatah questioned whether the process of selecting the private firm to develop the gas handling facility followed due process, including competitive bidding and transparency.
The PPADA (Sections 45-50) requires competitive procurement processes, transparency, and fairness in the selection of contractors for public projects. If the firm was selected without adhering to these procedures, it could constitute a breach of the Act.
Omtatah had specifically mentioned the lack of details on received proposals and justifications for contracting the firm, which aligns with the requirements of the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act (PPADA).
In violation of the Companies Act, Omtatah notes that KPC, as a state corporation registered under the Companies Act, should have followed corporate governance principles and legal obligations in its dealings.
The Companies Act (Sections 143–145) requires directors of a company to act in the best interests of the company and its shareholders, the Kenyan public. If the decision to hand over the project was not in the best interests of KPC or was made without proper board approval or shareholder consent, it could amount to a breach of fiduciary duty.
However, the government, in its response, defended the move, noting that a public-private partnership (PPP) was the best way to proceed with the project. They cited budgetary constraints, arguing that due process was followed in the project’s transfer.
As for whether the Ksh192 million would be recouped, the government noted that upcoming meetings with the firm would be key in finding a working formula for both parties.

NPS Cracks Whip After Woman Loses Pregnancy in Police Custody,NPS Cracks Whip After Woman Loses Pregnancy in Police Custody,"The National Police Service has ordered the immediate interdiction of the Rwanyambo Police Post Commander following an unfortunate incident in which a woman miscarried while in custody.
In an official statement, NPS spokesperson Muchiri Nyaga conveyed deep sadness over the incident and assured citizens that urgent measures are underway.
The woman allegedly lost a seven-month-old pregnancy while detained at a local police post in Kinangop, Nyandarua County, an event that has raised painful questions about the conditions of custody.
In response to the incident, an investigation has been launched by the Internal Affairs Unit (IAU), which will be working closely with the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) to determine the precise circumstances surrounding the case.

As part of the immediate action, NPS has interdicted the officer in charge of the police post, effectively removing him from power pending further investigations.
“To ensure a swift, impartial, and transparent investigation, the officer in charge of Rwanyambo Police Post has been interdicted with immediate effect,” the statement read in part.
“The NPS reaffirms its steadfast commitment to serving and protecting the public, while strictly upholding the rule of law, human rights, and fundamental freedoms”, the statement continued.
Nyaga acknowledged the incident as “deeply unfortunate” and affirmed the Service’s commitment to fully cooperate with the ongoing inquiry.
Authorities, however, did not reveal the specific details of the officer interdicted or when the interdiction would take place.
The latest incident continues to raise concerns over how police are handling Kenyans in custody.
According to the victim's sister, she had been arrested after her employer filed a complaint saying Ksh 18,000 from a day's sales was missing.
""I pleaded with the police to release my sister as we tried to raise the money, but they declined. I pleaded with them, informing them that my sister had other children waiting at home and we had a sick mother to take care of, but they refused,"" the victim's sister revealed.
These incidents in police custody continue to ignite concern among Kenyans who have accused the police of heightened brutality at the expense of Kenyan's lives.

Murkomen Reacts to Viral Video of Panga-Wielding Man Confronting Police,Murkomen Reacts to Viral Video of Panga-Wielding Man Confronting Police,"Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen has addressed the recent incident involving a panga-wielding man and police officers in Nakuru.
While speaking on Friday, June 13, the CS criticised Kenyans for supporting the man, noting that the incident could have easily turned chaotic.
""You see police officers trying to restore calm but then you see a man with a panga going after the police officers. Yet you will find some citizens cheering such a person in social media or today,"" Murkomen stated.
He stated that the government would be more stringent on such individuals, adding that the State would “hold civilians accountable.”

He cited the recent case of a police officer’s hand being chopped off during deadly clashes between citizens and police in Narok over a livestock-related issue as an example of what could happen when such incidents turn chaotic.
At the same time, he congratulated the police officers for exercising restraint in the face of the threat posed by the man.
In a viral clip that surfaced online, a man in London Estate, Nakuru, was seen wielding a panga towards police officers during protests.
The man could be seen seemingly threatening to attack the officers with the panga.
In response, an officer was seen lobbing a tear gas canister towards him in an attempt to thwart the man.
However, the man remained unfazed and went ahead to even ‘sharpen’ the panga on the road.
He continued to charge towards them, shouting endeni huko (go away) as the officers retreated.
The youth was among the charged protestors who took to the streets in Nakuru, demonstrating against the fatal shooting of 35-year-old Duncan Nderitu, reportedly by a police officer.
Reports revealed that Nderitu was killed during an altercation when police attempted to arrest a suspected drug peddler in the area. The confrontation reportedly turned chaotic as residents confronted the officers, prompting them to fire in the air to disperse the crowd.

Man Throws 5-Year-Old Baby from Balcony,Man Throws 5-Year-Old Baby from Balcony,"Residents of a Nairobi estate are mourning the death of five-year-old Amanda Mutheu, who lost her life at the hands of someone she trusted, her uncle.
In a devastating turn of events, witnesses recounted that the incident unfolded on Thursday night when the man, identified as her uncle by the police, stormed their house and found baby Mutheu in the company of her nanny.
Visibly disturbed and intoxicated, the man created a scene before overpowering the nanny and forcibly taking Mutheu from her arms. Sensing imminent danger, the house girl ran out, screaming for help.
Before anyone could intervene, tragedy struck, and the man threw the child from the balcony.

""The management security patrolling the area, along with neighbours who responded to the screams, rushed to the scene. They were able to subdue the uncle and called the police,"" a statement from the estate read in part.
Visibly angered by his inhumane actions, the residents launched a brutal assault on the man, beating him into a pulp. However, the police intervened swiftly, saving him from a mob intent on taking his life.
While defending himself, the man alleged that he loved the girl so much and could not have thrown her off the balcony; he claimed that what he threw was a doll.
""I did not throw Mutheu, I love her so much, what I threw was a doll, you can check on the CCTV footage, it's a doll that I threw, not a child,"" the man told the residents in a video seen by Kenyans.co.ke.
Police from Kahawa West Police Station booked the suspect at the station before taking him to the Kenyatta University Teaching and Referral Hospital, where he received treatment for the injuries sustained.
Mutheu was also taken to the same hospital and admitted to the emergency unit under the Intensive Care Unit. Unfortunately, minutes later, she was declared dead.
The incident has sent shockwaves among the residents, who are now demanding justice for the young girl who had a promising future. She had begun a career in acting, and from posted videos, Mutheu was talented.
The Sub-County Commander of Kasarani Police Station, Emmanuel Rono, has assured the community and the family that they will ensure justice is served.
""We want to assure the members of the public and the family that justice will be done,"" Rono assured.
Responding to the unfortunate events, the Federation of Women Lawyers in Kenya (FIDA-Kenya) has condemned the act, calling for quick justice for the baby. Consequently, FIDA has deployed an advocate to pursue this matter and follow up with the relevant authorities to ensure that the child and her family receive timely justice.

National Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi, while presenting the budget in the National Assembly on Thursday, June 12, said that in the Ksh105 billion budget, the National Youth Service will receive Ksh10 billion for training and recruitment.
He further announced an increase of Ksh318 million to the Youth Enterprise Development Fund, which provides loans to young entrepreneurs.
For the creative sector, under the Film Department Service, the government allocated Ksh990 million to be used for entertainment.

Additionally, the government proposed Ksh3.6 billion for the National Youth Opportunity Towards Advancement (NYOTA) program.
“I have proposed Ksh105.6 billion for these initiatives. This allocation includes: Ksh10.0 billion for the National Youth Service; Ksh3.6 billion to National Youth Opportunity Towards Advancement (NYOTA), and Ksh318 million for the Youth Enterprise Development Fund.""
""In addition, I have proposed Ksh990 million for Film Development Services,” CS Mbadi said.
Mbadi said that the Ksh300 million top-up would be allocated to the Hustler Fund to help with the loans.
This will provide low-interest loans to households and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to ease their financing difficulties.
Mbadi revealed that the Youth Enterprise Development Fund will receive an additional Ksh308 million to support young entrepreneurs through loans and business support.
“I have proposed an additional allocation of Ksh300 million to the Hustler Fund to scale up access to credit for households and MSMEs. I have also proposed an additional Ksh308 million for the youth enterprise development fund,” Mbadi said.
He noted that the proposed allocation is to expand financial and developmental job opportunities in the country.
To create more job opportunities for young people, CS Mbadi said the government has begun rolling out Climate WorX, a nationwide initiative aimed at employing over 110,000 youth across all 47 counties.
The programme, which was first launched last year in Nairobi’s informal settlements, is now being expanded countrywide following its initial success.
The CS described the initiative as a social support programme that empowers young people to improve their communities. 
“The youth will help build roads, plant trees, and clean up the environment in their neighbourhoods,” he said.

Mbagathi Hospital Medics Introduce Fresh Twist in Albert Ojwang Murder,Mbagathi Hospital Medics Introduce Fresh Twist in Albert Ojwang Murder,"A new twist has emerged in the unfortunate death of a teacher and social media influencer, Albert Ojwang, after a report by Mbagathi Hospital revealed that he was brought in already dead.
According to the report, Ojwang's body was brought in at 2:00am on Sunday, long after he had ceased to live.
This information is in sharp contrast to earlier claims by police officers that he was rushed to the hospital for immediate medical attention.
The report by the hospital detailed that Ojwang was discovered bearing extensive and gruesome injuries. His face was notably swollen, and his limbs were marred with a series of severe bruises, showing the violent nature of the attack.
A photo of Albert Ojwang, who passed away under unclear circumstances on Sunday, June 8 2025. PHOTO ALBERT OJWANG.
In a vivid description of the injuries, the nurses on duty revealed that Ojwang was oozing blood relentlessly from the back of his head, his mouth, and his eyes. 
Additionally, a distinct cut was noted in the parieto-occipital region, reinforcing the theory of a brutal assault rather than self-inflicted harm.
""His face was swollen. His body and limbs were marred by multiple bruises,"" the report details.
Through a careful medical examination, the nurses also observed that there was no chance for medical intervention; the teacher's condition was beyond help when he arrived.
Their accounts indicate that the body had been in a state of decay that is inconsistent with someone who had been alive minutes before.
Adding to the mystery, the hospital's documents disclosed that Ojwang's body was transported from the Central Police Station.
This detail directly contradicts the earlier narrative provided by police officials regarding his transport for emergency care. While police IG Douglas Kanja revealed that Ojwang was taken to the hospital at 1:39 am, the official hospital record marks his arrival at 2:00 am.
The inconsistency in timings, events, and his condition between the police and the hospital's reports raises serious questions about the chain of custody and the actual events at the police station.
This revelation by the hospital continues to raise more questions about the death that has sparked tension in the country. Already, businesses were brought to a standstill in Nairobi on Thursday as youths took to the streets demanding justice over the unfortunate incident.

Senator Flags ‘Secret Move’ Impacting Kiambu Locals,Senator Flags ‘Secret Move’ Impacting Kiambu Locals,"Kiambu County, led by Governor Kimani wa Matangi, has been put on the spot after the county senator, Karungo wa Thang'wa, raised an alarm over unexplained land rates in the county.
Appearing before the Senate's Standing Committee on Lands, the senator alleged that residents had been subjected to hiked land rates without prior notice or public participation.
According to the senator, the county is facing an arbitrary increase in land rates without proper legal process, transparency, or public participation, as mandated by the Constitution and the National Rating Act of 2025.
“Residents of Kiambu have reported a surge in land rates with no explanation, no notice, and no access to the valuation roll used to determine the charges,” the senator said.

The senator, who is now seeking a statement from the committee, is accusing the county leadership, led by the governor, of violating the principles of fairness, equity, and accountability in public governance.
While demanding accountability and a proper explanation, the senator now wants the county government to disclose whether a valuation roll exists, who prepared it, and when it was prepared.
The senator also wants evidence of public participation that led to the increased land rates and the legal basis used to calculate the current rates. The issue has sparked outrage among Kiambu property owners, many of whom claim they have been blindsided by the increase.
The senator questioned why residents are being forced to pay significantly higher land rates despite poor or non-existent service delivery, including road maintenance and waste management.
“It is unacceptable that citizens are being billed for services they do not receive. We will not allow the people of Kiambu to be overburdened by opaque taxation,” he emphasised.
The statement now awaits a formal response from the Chairperson of the Committee on Lands, who will be expected to investigate and provide clarity on the county government’s compliance with the law.
As tension mounts within the county over the land rates, all eyes are now on the governor and the entire leadership to address the concerns swiftly and uphold transparency in governance.
The issue of land rates in counties always proves to be a major issue, with business owners and counties brushing over the balance to raise county revenue and sustain businesses in the counties.

Billions NIS & Police Have Been Allocated in 2025/26 Budget,Billions NIS & Police Have Been Allocated in 2025/26 Budget,"In a bid to improve national security, the government has allocated over Ksh464.8 billion of the Ksh4.29 trillion 2025/26 budget to the sector.
While reading the budget on Thursday, June 12, the National Treasury Cabinet Secretary, John Mbadi, highlighted the crucial role of a safe nation in building the economy.
""A stable and secure environment fosters investment, trade, and overall economic growth,"" he stated.
The defence sector has been allocated the biggest chunk of the total, with a proposal of Ksh202.3 billion to run its affairs.

The National Police Service (NPS) follows shortly behind, having been allocated Ksh125.7 billion to enforce law and order across the country.
The intelligence and counter-intelligence agency, the National Intelligence Service (NIS), on the other hand, has been allocated Ksh51.4 billion to run its affairs.
Correctional services, through the Kenya Prisons Service, have been allocated Ksh38.1 billion, and lastly, the Internal Security National Administration has been allocated Ksh32.5 billion.
Besides these crucial sectors, Mbadi has also proposed several other millions that will be used to facilitate the security sector.
These include an additional allocation of Ksh10 billion for the leasing of police motor vehicles and Ksh3.6 billion for the Police Modernisation Programme.
To combat crime and enhance the administration of justice, Mbadi has also proposed Ksh1.2 billion to construct and modernise National Forensic Facilities.
The security sector is thus arguably one of the winners in the year's budget of Ksh4.29 trillion.
Elsewhere, to empower youth and women, Mbadi proposed Ksh10.0 billion for the National Youth Service; Ksh3.6 billion for the National Youth Opportunity Towards Advancement (NYOTA), and Ksh318 million for the Youth Enterprise Development Fund.

How the 2025/2026 Budget Will Affect Income Tax,How the 2025/2026 Budget Will Affect Income Tax,"Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi has outlined a raft of income tax changes in the 2025/2026 Budget, aimed at boosting revenue collection while easing the burden on Kenyan workers and businesses.
While presenting the budget estimates before the National Assembly, Mbadi announced that the Finance Bill 2025 would introduce reforms to eliminate ambiguities in tax laws and promote equity within the tax system.
Among the notable changes is the full exemption of all gratuity payments, whether from the public or private sector, from taxation.
This move follows the enactment of the Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 2024, which had exempted pensions and gratuity payments but left uncertainty around gratuities from private pension schemes.
An aerial view of the National Assembly chambers during budget reading on June 12, 2025. PHOTO NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
This means retirees across both public and private sectors will take home their full terminal benefits without any deductions, offering financial relief to thousands of Kenyans exiting the workforce.
“To eliminate any confusion, we are now proposing an amendment to clarify that all gratuity payments are exempt from tax,” Mbadi stated.
In a move targeting cross-border tax disputes involving multinationals, the Bill will also empower the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) Commissioner to enter into Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) with multinational companies. This is expected to reduce litigation and ensure predictable tax treatment for global firms operating in Kenya.
For local businesses, the Treasury has proposed accelerated tax relief on industrial and operational items, such as linen and tools. 
Under the new plan, businesses will be allowed to deduct the full cost of qualifying items in the year of purchase, a departure from the current practice of spreading deductions over three years.
To promote home ownership, the Finance Bill proposes expanding mortgage interest relief to include individuals who take loans to construct their own residential homes. Currently, this relief is only available for mortgages used to purchase or improve existing homes.
If passed, the change will allow Kenyans building their own homes to benefit from tax relief on interest paid on construction loans, just like those buying or renovating houses. The move aims to make home ownership more affordable and inclusive.
“These measures are designed to stimulate economic activity, promote fairness in tax treatment, and provide clarity in implementation,” the CS added.
The proposed changes are expected to take effect in the new fiscal year, subject to parliamentary approval of the Finance Bill.

Police Make First Arrest in Albert Ojwang Murder,Police Make First Arrest in Albert Ojwang Murder,"Authorities have made their first arrest in the case involving the murder of blogger Albert Ojwang.
A police officer attached to the Central Police Station was apprehended on Thursday, June 12, with reports reaching Kenyans.co.ke indicating he is being held at the Capitol Hill Police Station. 
“Please be informed that an officer of Central Police Station Nairobi, was arrested today, 12/06/2025 and placed in custody at Capitol Hill Police Station by officers from the Internal Affairs Unit (IAU) and the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA),” a memo released on the evening of Thursday, June 12 read. 
The arrest followed an extensive investigation by the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA), which revealed to the Administration and Internal Security Committee that an arrest announcement would be confirmed on Thursday.

On Wednesday, IPOA released the names of six officers involved in the arrest of Ojwang’ from the Leaders Centre in Homa Bay County on Friday, June 7.
Notably, the arrested officer was not among the names released by Vice Chairperson Ann Mwangi before the Senate.
While it remains unclear whether the arrested officer was directly involved in Ojwang's killing, his apprehension is believed to be linked to glaring inconsistencies in how officers handled the situation when the late influencer was first brought to the station.
In addition to allegedly failing to book Ojwang, officers on duty on June 7 have come under scrutiny after it emerged that CCTV cameras had been tampered with.
IPOA Chairperson Issack Hassan revealed on Thursday that digital video recorder (DVR) logs showed the discs were replaced on June 8, 2025, at exactly 07:23:29 and 07:23:48 hours after Ojwang was brought in.
According to IPOA’s account, Ojwang was booked at 9:35 p.m. on June 7.
Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja also revealed on Thursday that experts were looking at the CCTV hard drive to reconstruct footage.
Investigations are also closing in on the individual responsible for unplugging the CCTV power source, after it emerged that the cameras were conveniently offline around the time Ojwang was brought into the station.

Senator Onyonka Makes Bold Demand Ahead of 2027 Elections,Senator Onyonka Makes Bold Demand Ahead of 2027 Elections,"Kisii Senator Richard Onyonka has called for a review of constituency boundaries ahead of the 2027 General Election.
On Thursday, June 12, Onyonka urged the Senate Standing Committee on Justice, Legal Affairs, and Human Rights to fast-track the process, noting that it is long overdue.
According to Onyonka, the accelerating population growth in some counties, such as Kisii, Nyamira, and Migori Counties, will undermine equitable representation in the upcoming general polls if constituency boundaries are not reviewed on time.
Onyonka further emphasised the need for clear policies to prevent future delays in boundary reviews and to uphold the constitutional rights of Kenyan citizens to fair representation in Parliament.

""The Senator expressed concern that population growth in counties such as Kisii, Nyamira, and Migori has resulted in constituencies that are disproportionately large, undermining the principle of equitable representation,"" a statement from Parliament read.
""The review of constituency and ward boundaries, as required by Article 89 of the Constitution, is overdue and must be conducted to ensure fairness in representation and effective service delivery,"" it added.
The Constitution mandates the IEBC to review constituency boundaries and names at intervals of not less than eight years and not more than twelve years.
The IEBC last reviewed constituency boundaries on March 7, 2012. The next review, which was initially scheduled for 2020, has been delayed by four years.
The issue of constituency boundaries has long stirred debate in Kenya’s political space. A month ago, former Farmers Party Leader Irungu Nyakera warned that 27 constituencies risk being scrapped if the boundary review process is not initiated soon.
Nyakera, in a statement on Tuesday, April 22, said that the scrapping of these constituencies, which he claims their existence is temporary, would affect the upcoming general elections because it would mean that no member of parliament could be elected from them in the 2027 general elections.
According to Nyakera, these constituencies were created in 2010 under an exception, as they did not meet the population threshold required by the Constitution.
“To avert an impending crisis, the IEBC should be immediately reconstituted, and the NADCO legislative proposals enacted to either extend the timeline for the boundary review or provide permanent protection for these constituencies,” Nyakera said. “The Supreme Court should also give its advisory opinion and provide legal clarity.”
He added that the Constitution allowed the constituencies to exist temporarily on the condition that the IEBC would conduct a boundary review by March 2024 at the latest.

Details of the reason why the student took his own life remain scanty, but Kenyans took the opportunity to challenge parents and families to be actively involved in their children's lives.
In response to the unfortunate incident, ELDOWAS has temporarily shut down the Kesses Water Treatment Plant as a precautionary measure.
Comprehensive cleaning, flushing, and disinfection of the treatment tanks and pipelines are currently underway, with public health authorities supervising the process.
Additionally, independent laboratory testing has been commissioned to ensure that the water meets all regulatory safety standards before supply is fully restored. ELDOWAS has assured customers that no contaminated water has been distributed.
""Independent laboratory testing is being conducted to ensure that all water meets regulatory safety standards before supply is restored. To minimize service disruption, alternative water supply arrangements have been activated for the affected areas,"" the facility added.
This incident comes barely a month after yet another youth had thrown himself from a building in Thika.
Cases of suicide among the youth remain alarmingly high. While Kenya continues to advocate for mental health, many young people are silently battling challenges that may be contributing to the rising cases.
General mental health struggles, alongside financial, academic, and social pressures, have been identified as key factors driving the unfortunate trend.

State Gives Way Forward on Ngong Forest Evictions,State Gives Way Forward on Ngong Forest Evictions,"The government has clarified its stance on potential evictions from the disputed 34-acre section of Ngong Forest.
Environment, Climate Change and Forestry Cabinet Secretary Deborah Barasa appeared before the National Assembly’s Committee on Implementation on Thursday, June 12, where she assured residents occupying the contested land that no evictions would take place until a Cabinet decision is reached.
According to the CS, the Ministry had complied with previous House resolutions that directed a halt to threats or attempts to repossess the land from residents in Lang’ata Constituency.
“After the advice from Parliament, no threats from government or the Kenya Forest Service have been issued to the residents, and normalcy has been achieved,” she said.

The land in question, which hosts more than 20,000 families, has long been the subject of dispute from as far back as 2020.
Initially, the residents claimed they acquired the property legally. However, this claim was disputed after the arrival of Kenya Forest Service (KFS) rangers, who said the land belongs to the agency.
Earlier, the house adopted a report by the Departmental Committee on Environment and Natural Resources recommending amicable dialogue between the Ministry and its residents.
After the adoption of the report, CS Barasa revealed that KFS officers toned down with the series of threats, which was previously the norm.
Further, the CS noted that constructive engagements had already taken place between forest management authorities and communities in the area, and there was peaceful coexistence between government agencies and the residents.
“All public forests are managed by the government for the public good, for present and future generations. It is the responsibility of the government to maintain and protect the integrity of public forests, including the creation of institutions,"" CS Barasa added.
""Furthermore, the Forest Conservation and Management Act (FCMA), Cap 385, provides for Community Forest Associations for members of the public living around all public forests.""
Several establishments sit within the 34-acre area, including Lang’ata View Estate, Shalom Estate, Forest Edge View Estate, St. Mary’s Hospital, Lang’ata Women Prison, the Police Dog Unit, and Bomas of Kenya, among others.
As per the House resolution on Thursday, any legal process involving the land must comply with Section 34 of the FCMA, 2016, which deals with the variation of boundaries or revocation of public forests.
Specifically, the Act outlines the step-by-step process through which the boundaries of public forests can be altered or the registration of a public forest, or part of it, revoked.

Govt Announces SIM Card Changes for Refugees in Kenya,Govt Announces SIM Card Changes for Refugees in Kenya,"The government has urged all refugees in the country to refrain from registering their SIM cards using borrowed Kenyan IDs and instead use their own Refugee IDs.
In a notice on Thursday, June 12, the Department of Refugee Services announced that all refugees in the country can legally register their SIM cards using their Refugee ID, enabling access to essential services such as mobile money.
The department directed all refugees who had used someone else’s ID card to register their SIM cards to immediately regularise their registration.
According to the department, registering a SIM card with another person’s ID violates Regulation 9 of the new Kenya Information and Communications Regulations, 2025.

“Pursuant to the gazettement of The Kenya Information and Communications (Registration of Telecommunications Service Subscribers) Regulations 2025, DRS is hereby urging all refugees who have registered mobile phone SIM cards using borrowed Kenyan IDs to cease the practice immediately and regularise their SIM card registration,” it stated.
“Proxy registration of SIM cards is therefore in violation of Regulation 9 of the new Kenya Information and Communications Regulations, 2025. All concerned individuals are urged to take immediate action to comply,” it added.
The announcement comes two months after the Cabinet, through a statement on Tuesday, March 11, endorsed the Shirika Plan, a strategy aimed at supporting refugees with a focus on long-term development rather than short-term aid.
Through the plan, the government aims to integrate refugees into host communities, addressing issues that have led to unrest and protests among refugee populations.
Under the Shirika plan, refugees in the country will also be given opportunities to work and contribute to the country's economy.
Furthermore, according to the Cabinet, refugee camps will be transformed into areas with essential infrastructure like schools, hospitals, and housing through the plan.
""In addressing refugee management, the Cabinet endorsed the Shirika Plan, a transformative framework shifting Kenya’s approach from humanitarian aid to a development-focused model,"" the statement read.
""The plan seeks to integrate refugees into host communities by transforming camps into sustainable settlements equipped with essential infrastructure, resources, and economic opportunities,""  it added.

US Issues Warning After Protests in Nairobi CBD,US Issues Warning After Protests in Nairobi CBD,"U.S. citizens have been warned against going to the Nairobi Central Business District (CBD) after protests took a chaotic turn on Thursday, June 12.
In a travel advisory, the United States Department of State cited the use of tear gas and live ammunition as an indication that the demonstrations pose a risk, particularly to American citizens.
""Violent protests are currently underway in the Central Business District (CBD) of Nairobi,"" the alert stated. ""Unverified reports have indicated the use of tear gas and live ammunition.""
As a result, the Bureau of Consular Affairs urged U.S. citizens currently in Kenya to exercise extreme caution and avoid the CBD until the situation stabilises.

Part of the cautionary measures U.S. citizens were urged to observe included avoiding crowds and notifying friends and family of their whereabouts at all times.
The bureau also advised its citizens to always carry their U.S. passport with a valid Kenyan visa in case they are required to present it to authorities.
Additionally, U.S. citizens were encouraged to follow local media for fresh developments and updates on the ongoing protests.
By Thursday afternoon, protests in the Nairobi CBD had escalated, forcing police to disperse an irate crowd using teargas canisters.
The demonstrations disrupted activities for most of the afternoon, with protestors turning up in their hundreds to rally around two main issues, the murder of blogger Albert Ojwang' and the 2025/2026 Budget, which was presented before Parliament by Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi.
Vandalism was also reported, with several newly installed bins removed from their original stations and carried along the roads by protestors, despite earlier warnings from the county government issued less than a month ago.
An unfortunate scene unfolded near Kenya Cinema, where two vehicles were set ablaze amid clashes between civilians and anti-riot police.
In its advisory, the U.S. also urged its citizens to keep their doors locked and windows rolled up while travelling in private vehicles.
