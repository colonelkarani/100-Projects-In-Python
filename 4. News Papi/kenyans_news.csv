Govt Revokes Licenses of 13 Nairobi Transport Operators,"The Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) will, in the next seven days, revoke the operating licenses of 13 courier operators stationed in Nairobi.
In a gazette notice dated June 13, 2025, the authority confirmed that the operators include four international courier operators and nine national courier operators.
""NOTICE is given pursuant to the provisions of the Kenya Information and Communications Act (Cap. 411A) that the Communications Authority of Kenya shall revoke the postal licences of the following service providers within seven (7) days from the date of this Gazette Notice,"" the notice stated.  
The International Courier Operators include Afrasia Courier Express, Courier Plus Logistics, Rioma Courier Services Limited, and Delta Handling Services.

The National Courier operators include Crucible Investment, Ultimate North, Cilantro Solutions, Classic Luxury, Diamond Parcel Limited, EMD Solutions Company Limited, Four M Africa Limited, Eve on the Move Limited, and Garvins Logistics.
Courier service providers focus on the delivery of parcels, documents, and goods in the country and across borders.
If the government revokes the licenses of a courier service provider, it means the company is no longer authorised to provide parcel transportation services.
A courier service provider's license can be revoked for several reasons, primarily because of failing to meet regulatory requirements and maintain service quality.
However, other common causes include non-payment of license renewal fees, failure to meet service quality standards, and privacy and data security breaches
It is not the first time the authority has revoked licenses of courier services. Through a gazette notice dated July 6, 2024, the CA also scrapped the licenses of 27 courier operators.
""Upon revocation of the licences listed hereabove, the service providers/operators shall not be authorised to operate and provide the service,"" the gazette notice read.
The CA is the body mandated with regulating and licencing companies intending to offer courier services across the country.

"Police Officer Dies, Scores Injured in Speeding Road Crash","Three people, including a police officer, died early Sunday morning following a road crash at the Slopes Villa area in Kinangop, Nyandarua County.
The incident involved a police vehicle and a double-cabin pickup, with reports indicating that the officers were responding to another accident in the vicinity when the crash occurred.
According to the Motorists Association, the police vehicle was reportedly speeding when it collided head-on with the pickup truck.
Several other occupants from both vehicles sustained serious injuries and were rushed to nearby hospitals for emergency treatment.

“The police vehicle, reportedly speeding while responding to another accident nearby, collided with the pickup, leading to a tragic outcome. Sadly, three lives were lost on the spot, including that of a police officer and one civilian,” the statement read.
“This heartbreaking incident serves as a grim reminder of the dangers faced by emergency responders and the importance of road safety for all. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the deceased and those injured.”
On June 3, several police officers died after their patrol vehicle collided with a trailer at Matisi along the Bungoma-Webuye Highway. Reports indicated that the two vehicles crashed head-on, leaving the police car completely wrecked.
Last year, a police vehicle veered off its lane and crashed into an oncoming 14-seater matatu along the Kericho-Sotik Highway. Although no fatalities were reported, the officer sustained minor injuries. Witnesses at the scene claimed the officer may have been driving under the influence.
Additionally, in April last year, a police officer was tragically reported dead after his car crashed near the Lusaka roundabout on Uhuru Highway. 
Industrial Area OCPD Judith Nyongesa stated that the officer, who was attached to the Gigiri police station, was travelling from the City Centre towards Mlolongo.
Between January and March 2025, Kenya experienced a concerning number of road accidents, resulting in 1,139 fatalities, according to the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA).
This marked a slight decrease from the 1,166 deaths recorded during the same period in 2024.
The NTSA reported that pedestrians were the most affected group, accounting for 420 of the fatalities, followed by motorcyclists (301), passengers (189), pillion passengers (130), drivers (83), and pedal cyclists (16).

Why EPRA Could Raise Fuel Prices Again,"The prices of petroleum products surge again as the global hostilities push oil prices amid hostilities in the Middle East.
The Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) on Saturday announced that super petrol prices are set to increase following the latest fuel review. In the review, EPRA revealed that petrol had increased by Ksh2.69 per litre, while diesel and kerosene had decreased by Ksh1.95 and Ksh2.06 per litre, respectively.
Consequently, super petrol now retails at Ksh177.32, diesel at Ksh162.91, and kerosene at Ksh146.93 per litre in Nairobi. The upward revision comes amid growing concerns over global oil market instability, with analysts warning that geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could trigger further hikes.
Over the past week, reports of missile attacks, drone strikes, and retaliatory threats between Israel and Iran have unsettled oil markets.

Iran, a key member of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), plays a central role in the global oil supply chain, and any disruption to its output or infrastructure could tighten supply, triggering further price surges.
The oil futures curve is strengthening on concerns that Israel’s latest strike on Iran could have severe and long-lasting repercussions. Front-month Brent prices have spiked by as much as 13 per cent, according to Bloomberg. 
The region, which supplies a significant share of the world's crude oil, is facing heightened volatility due to ongoing conflicts and fears of disruption in key shipping lanes such as the Red Sea and the Strait of Hormuz.
Energy experts have noted that recent attacks, coupled with simmering tensions involving Iran and its regional proxies, have increased the risk of supply delays and higher transportation costs. These developments have already prompted oil tankers to avoid traditional routes within the Red Sea, increasing global shipping costs and pushing up refined fuel prices.
Kenya, which relies heavily on fuel imports, remains vulnerable to such external shocks. EPRA has already signalled that international price trends are factored into local reviews, meaning any sustained turmoil in the Middle East could translate into higher costs for motorists and households in the coming months.
In its weekly review, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) noted, “International oil prices increased during the week, with Murban crude rising to Ksh8,816.61 (USD 68.24) per barrel on June 12, up from Ksh8,383.79 (USD 64.89) on June 5. This rise was primarily driven by heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.”
The timing is particularly sensitive for Kenya, which imports nearly all its refined fuel. Higher crude costs ripple through wholesale and retail stages, risking steeper prices for consumers. If geopolitical volatility persists, motorists, transport operators, and low-income households may brace for further strain on disposable incomes.
Meanwhile, according to EPRA, the average landed cost of imported super petrol increased by 0.35 per cent from US$588.16 (Ksh76,166) per cubic metre in April 2025 to US$590.24 (Ksh76,436) in May 2025.
Conversely, diesel decreased by 2.42 per cent from US$594.60 (Ksh77,000) per cubic metre to US$580.23 (Ksh75,139), while Kerosene decreased by 5.14 per cent from US$599.84 (Ksh77,679) per cubic metre to US$569.00 (Ksh73,685) per cubic metre over the same period.

Governor Loses Father on Father's Day,"Kilifi Governor Gideon Mung'aro is in mourning after the loss of his father, who tragically passed away on June 15, a day set aside to celebrate fathers.
In a heartfelt post shared on his official social media on Sunday, the Kilifi County boss expressed deep sorrow at the untimely loss, describing the moment as particularly painful given the day’s significance.
“Today, on Father’s Day, I lost my father. It’s a deeply painful moment, but I’m truly grateful for the love, support, and prayers from family, friends, and all who’ve reached out. Your kindness is helping us through this difficult time. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart,” he wrote.
The message sparked an outpouring of condolences from Kenyans, fellow leaders, and supporters, many acknowledging the weight of losing a dad on a day meant to celebrate them.

Governor Mung'aro has since shared images of himself and some acquaintances at the Kilifi County Hospital Funeral Home, where his late dad's body was being kept. 
Details surrounding the cause of death or funeral arrangements had not been made public at the time of this publication.
In the wake of the governor's announcement, the Orange Democratic Party, which was the political vehicle in which Mung'aro won his gubernatorial seat, has since shared a message of condolence, hailing the deceased as a 'great man'. 
""On this Father’s Day, a great man has slept. Ex-Chief Gideon Baya Mung’aro a man who made the modern Malindi and Dabaso what it is today,"" a statement from ODM read. 
""To our comrade Gideon Mung’aro and the entire Mung’aro family and the people of Kilifi County, poleni sana for the loss.""
This is the latest tragedy rocking Kilifi county involving a senior government official. On April 1, former ODM Chairperson in Magarini, Kilifi County, Ahmed Maamun Ali passed away in a death which was described as sudden. 
Weeks later, on June 2, former Kilifi County Executive Committee Member Alphonce Mwambura lost his life nearly eight years after he left his job in the public service.
Tokali's passing was confirmed by Senate Speaker Amason Kingi, who hailed him as a public servant who worked with ""utmost diligence and respect"".

Thousands to Lose Jobs After 74 Companies Shut Down,"Over 243 companies in different products and services are set to shut their doors after being removed from the Register of Companies, spelling doom for thousands of workers.
In a gazette notice dated June 13, the Deputy Registrar of Companies, Hiram Gachugi, stated that 74 companies have already been struck off the register of companies.
From the list provided by Gachugi, the said companies are from diverse sectors, including health, construction, water, trading, energy, transport, and manufacturing, among others.
""PURSUANT to section 897 (4) of the Companies Act, it is notified for the information of the general public that the following companies are dissolved and their names have been struck off the Register of Companies with effect from the date of this publication,"" the notice stated.

Gachuhi further noted that if no opposition is submitted within the next three months, 169 more companies would be removed from the registry of companies.
""PURSUANT to section 897 (3) of the Companies Act, the Registrar of Companies gives notice that the names of the companies specified hereunder shall be struck-off from the Register of Companies at the expiry of three months from the date of this publication, and invites any person to show cause why the companies should not be struck-off from the Register of Companies,"" he stated.  
The Registrar of Companies can initiate the dissolution of a company under several circumstances, including if the company has defied several laws, such as not filing annual returns or operating without proper documentation.
Other circumstances that can lead to a company being dissolved include Insolvency, where a company cannot pay its debts, voluntary dissolution, fraud, or misconduct are other reasons why companies are dissolved in Kenya
For a company to open up again after dissolution, it must apply for restoration, either through the High Court or directly through the registrar.
During the application process, the company will be required to demonstrate that it was in operation at the time of striking off and that six years have not lapsed since the dissolution.
The announcement comes exactly a week after the registrar of companies, through a gazette notice dated June 5, announced the dissolution of a multinational, Caltex House Service Station Limited.
The oil and motor care company with over 75 years of service has 165 service stations across the country and has hired thousands of Kenyans.

Ruto Extends Tenures of 50 Appointees,"President William Ruto has extended the terms of two special committees, the Technical Working Group on Gender-Based Violence, including Femicide and a panel at the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR).
In concurrent notices in the June 13 issue of the Kenya Gazette, the head of Public Service, Felix Koskei, announced the changes that are expected to extend the tenure of the 50 total appointees for 30 days and 10 days, respectively.
Firstly, the term of the Technical Working Group on Gender-Based Violence (GBV), including Femicide, was extended by thirty days, effective June 9 to end on July 8.
“It is notified for the general information of the public that His Excellency Hon. William Samoei Ruto, President of the Republic of Kenya and Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces, has extended the term of the Technical Working Group on Gender-Based Violence (GBV), including Femicide for a period of thirty (30) days, with effect from the 9th June, 2025 up-to the 8th July, 2025.

President Ruto appointed the 42-member committee on January 10, with Dr Nancy Baraza slated to lead it. 
Other notable members of the committee are the Law Society of Kenya President, Faith Odhiambo, crime and investigative journalist Franklin Wallah, former MP and minister Linah Jebii Kilimo and Dr Sam Thenya, the founder of the Nairobi Women's Hospital. 
It was put in place to address the rising number of gender-based violence and femicide cases that had sparked public uproar.
The group was tasked with the responsibility of assessing, reviewing, and recommending measures to strengthen the institutional, legal, and policy response to GBV and femicide in the country by focusing on identifying trends, strengthening legal frameworks, and proposing actionable measures to combat the pervasive issue. 
On the other hand, he extended the tenure of the selection panel for the recruitment of nominees for appointment as the chairperson of the KNCHR for 10 days.
“It is notified for the general information of the public that His Excellency, Hon. William Samoei Ruto, President of the Republic of Kenya and Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces, in exercise of the powers conferred by section 11 (15) of the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights Act, 2011, has extended the period specified under section 11 (4) of the Act by ten (10) days and under section 11 (5) of the Act by ten (10) days, in respect of the tenure of the Selection Panel appointed vide Gazette Notice No. 4651/2025 of 11th April, 2025,” the notice read.

Kalonzo Addresses Joining Govt,"Kalonzo Musyoka has dismissed reports that he is preparing to join President William Ruto’s government, terming the claims as diversionary and dishonest.
Kalonzo was responding to remarks by Deputy President Kithure Kindiki, who over the weekend expressed interest in engaging the opposition leader for possible cooperation. 
A subsequent report by the Standard suggested that Kalonzo could be rethinking his political stance—a shift that analysts warned could fracture the opposition’s unity ahead of the 2027 elections.
In a swift response, Kalonzo dismissed the claims, describing them as a “poor attempt to divide the United Opposition.”

The Wiper leader also appeared to take a personal swipe at Kindiki, who replaced Rigathi Gachagua as Deputy President following a high-stakes fallout within Kenya Kwanza. Referring to him as “Mr HalfTam,” Kalonzo appeared to question Kindiki’s legitimacy and mocked his controversial mid-term rise to power.
“This is all diversionary and a poor attempt to divide the United Opposition. I cannot work with or meet up with people with Gen Z blood on their hands, including that of Albert Ojwang. Kenyans know the truth, Mr HalfTam: I will always be on the side of the people,” Kalonzo said in a statement, referencing the recent death of Ojwang inside Nairobi's Central Police Station.
While on a tour of the Ukambani region, Kindiki suggested that he enjoyed a cordial relationship with the opposition figure and therefore would consider luring him to the government. 
“I respect Kalonzo, who is my senior in law and is full of respect for all leaders. I will talk to him because what we want to see is the development of the region like every other part of the country,” Kindiki stated.
The DP, who has been spearheading empowerment forums in the region for the last week and has been to Machakos Town, Masinga, Kangundo, Yatta, Mwala, Kitui East, Kitui Central, Kitui South, Kaiti, Kilome and Makueni constituencies, said he would endeavour to look for Kalonzo for discussions and consultations on development.
“I will look for him as you have tasked me to do so. We do not want him to be misled by those keen to destabilise the country through divisive and tribal politics,” DP assured.
Attempts to woo Kalonzo to the government have intensified, following the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding between President Ruto and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga. Kalonzo has emerged as the lone voice in the opposition, with leaders allied to the government urging him to join the arrangement.
However, Kalonzo has maintained his stance, previously insisting that he would not join the government, especially if the arrangements are not to benefit any Kenyan.

On the other hand, Attorney General Dorcas Oduor has appointed Samson Alosa and Kenneth Kiptoo Boit as members of the governing council of the National Crime Research Centre for a period of three years.

KDF Speaks After Deadly Plane Crash,"The Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) has mourned the death of two air force pilots in an air crash on Saturday, June 14, in Kwale County.
In a statement on Sunday morning, KDF confirmed that the two officers were engaged in a training activity when the Kenya Air Force Grob 120A aircraft ran into an emergency.
KDF further stated that investigation teams had been deployed to the crash scene to determine the cause of the accident.
""Yesterday, 14th June 2025, a Kenya Air Force Grob 120A aircraft experienced an emergency while on a training flight and crashed in the general area of Mwakijembe Primary School, Mafundani village, Kwale County. On board were two pilots,"" part of the statement read.

""With deep sadness, we confirm the passing of both pilots in the crash. The Kenya Air Force has constituted and dispatched investigation teams to establish the cause of the air crash. May the Almighty Lord rest the souls of the departed heroes in peace and grant their families fortitude at this time of deep sorrow.""
However, KDF has yet to confirm the identities of the two officers who perished in the crash or the cause of the emergency itself.
On Saturday, the County Commissioner Stephen Orinde confirmed the incident after an aircraft at Ndavaya, Kinango.
""Earlier today, 14th June 2025, a Kenya Air Force Grob 120A aircraft experienced an emergency while on a training flight in the general area of Mwakijembe Primary School, Ndavaya, Kwale County. On Board were two pilots. Recovery is ongoing,"" added Kenya's military body.
Reportedly, the ill-fated aircraft departed Mombasa at 11:39am and was last seen near Diani before disappearing from radar. It crashed at approximately 12:06 pm, just 27 minutes after takeoff.
Images obtained by Kenyans.co.ke showed the aftermath of the crash, with the roof of the aircraft completely torn off. In the cockpit, only the seats remained, with the nose of the plane left with just spare parts. 
Compared with the plane's tail, which had limited damage, the front section was completely damaged, supposedly signalling that the plane nose-dived to the ground. 
Aside from the two officers, no civilian casualties were reported despite the area of the crash being populated by onlookers who milled around as emergency response teams worked to try and rescue the two pilots.

Several Feared Dead as Fire Guts Four-Storey Building in Nairobi,"Several people are feared to have passed away following a fire incident that caught a four-storey building in Nairobi's Kawangware estate. 
The fire occurred in the Stage 2 area of the Congo area in the populous Kawangware estate. It is suspected to have been caused by an electrical fault.
According to eyewitnesses, the fire began spreading rapidly, with thick black smoke engulfing the air. 
Local kiosks, shops, and several houses were affected, with the occupants forced to temporarily scamper for safety, fearing the fire could spread over. 
A collage of a fire incident ravaging a residential area at Kawangware 56 in Nairobi County on Friday, January 3, 2025.
Images and videos obtained by Kenyans.co.ke depicted the locals who were recording from across the road calling for emergency response.
One of the locals could be heard crying for help, revealing that a neighbour was allegedly one of the victims, with their doors locked and unable to open their doors. 
""My neighbour is locked inside. Who will help her? She cannot be able to come out,"" the lady's voice could be heard amid the confusion. 
However, residents raised concerns over the poor state of roads, which made it impossible for fire trucks from the county brigade to access the affected areas.
Two people were injured and dozens left homeless after a fire razed at least 28 houses in Kawangware 56, Dagoretti North, on January 4 this year.
The flames were linked to an explosion at a gas and petrol refilling shop situated in the densely populated residential area of Kawangware, which has been synonymous with regular outbreaks.
According to witnesses, the incident, which also left business owners counting losses, was preceded by a gas leak.
Separately, the government has often cited the Affordable Housing agenda as a long-term solution to the recurring fire tragedies in informal settlements.
Public Service CS Georey Ruku, on Wednesday, echoed this position, stating, ""The affordable housing projects in informal settlements spearheaded by President William Ruto are a sustainable solution to such incidents and will ensure the government protects the lives and properties of Kenyans while providing humane and decent living environments.""

""He confirmed that over 74,000 digital devices will be distributed to public health facilities nationwide to support more efficient, data-driven service delivery,"" the ministry stated.
In a statement on Thursday, April 24, Duale claimed that in addition to providing digital devices and reliable connectivity to healthcare workers, the ministry will also integrate advanced tools such as artificial intelligence and machine learning in healthcare facilities to improve health management and clinical decisions.
The Health CS further claimed that the government is also in the process of erecting a locally hosted sovereign health cloud to securely store and manage patient data in these facilities.
It will further leverage the Digital Health System to intensify its crackdown on unqualified healthcare practitioners and facilities in a bid to safeguard the integrity of the country's healthcare, according to Duale.
""He highlighted intensified efforts to crack down on unqualified health practitioners and shut down non-compliant facilities to safeguard the integrity of the health system,"" it stated.
The healthcare boss asserted that improving the technological capacity of the country's healthcare facilities will be critical in rolling out the SHA and propelling it towards the Universal Healthcare Coverage (UHC).
""The ongoing digital transformation in the Health Sector is a result of the mandate bestowed upon the Ministry of Health under the Health Act of 2017, specifically sections 104 and 105 on the digitisation of the healthcare sector,"" the statement read.
""CS Duale urged CHPs to actively promote SHA and SHIF registration, emphasising their vital role in ensuring every Kenyan, regardless of age or income, can access quality healthcare,"" the ministry stated.

Omtatah Calls for Arrest of DCI Boss,"Busia Senator Okiya Omtatah has called for the resignation and arrest of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) boss, Mohammed Amin, following the inconsistencies recorded on Albert Ojwang's death.
In a statement on Sunday morning, the presidential hopeful stated that Amin needed to be held accountable after CCTV footage debunked the DCI's claims.
In the CCTV footage provided by Mbagathi Hospital, it was confirmed that the late blogger was at the hospital at 1:35am despite the DCI's earlier assertion that he was still at the Central Police Station at that time.
""At 1:35am, CCTV footage from Mbagathi Hospital, aired by Citizen TV, confirmed Albert Ojwang was already dead. Yet DCI Boss Mohamed Amin claimed he was in a police cell at that exact time. We demand the immediate arrest of all officers involved. And yes, DCI Director Mohamed Amin must go,"" Omtatah stated.

As such, Omtatah claimed that Ojwang's death had to have been premeditated and went beyond just incompetence.
According to him, the killing had been covered up by fake Occurrence Book entries, fake medical reports, and a coordinated cover-up.
""We demand the immediate arrest of all officers involved. And yes, DCI Director Mohamed Amin must go. You don’t lie to a nation and walk free,"" part of the statement read.
""Who ordered this? Who covers up these killings? How many more must die before something changes? We’re not pleading. We’re demanding. Albert Ojwang’s blood cries out for justice. And this time, we will not back down,"" he added.
Over the past week, the death of Ojwang has captured the attention of Kenyans, with several calling for the arrest and resignation of the Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Eliud Lagat, who was the complainant in the case that landed Ojwang behind bars.
On Saturday, June 14, just a week after his death, CCTV footage emerged showing police officers driving into Mbagathi Hospital at 1:35am, and the subsequent events that followed
The development comes just a day after another suspect was arrested by authorities on allegations of deleting CCTV footage at Nairobi's Central Police Station, where Ojwang was held before his death.
Reportedly, the technician, who had overseen the installation of all 25 cameras at the station in 2024, was called on June 8 by a police officer at Central Police Station. Aside from the cameras, the man also installed a digital video recorder (DVR) where all captured footage is stored.

Govt to Begin Arrest of Protestors,"The Nairobi County Government has warned that those who were involved in the destruction of infrastructure within the city during the protests last week will be apprehended.
Speaking in Kamagut on Saturday, June 14, Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja claimed that investigations by security agencies have already uncovered who vandalised county infrastructure and other properties across the city during demonstrations.
According to Sakaja, the individuals, whom he labelled as 'criminals,' who masqueraded as protesters and destroyed the recently installed lighting and sanitation infrastructure, eclipsed the original motive of the demonstrations, which was to protest the recent death of Albert Ojwang, who died in police custody on Sunday, June 8.
“Even if we are angry, let’s not destroy our property. If we must demonstrate, let us do so peacefully. The next time, let no one try to destroy infrastructure, burn cars, steal from businesses, or cause chaos,” Sakaja said.

“The Constitution allows peaceful demonstrations, not violence. We must protect our businesses. What happened will not be allowed to happen again,” he added.
According to Umoja, one MCA, Ronald Mugambi, the destruction of property during demonstrations undermined the solid infrastructural progress the country's capital has engineered over the years.
“Don’t destroy what has taken us years to build. We will not allow this to continue—people losing their businesses and infrastructure being vandalised. Next time they try, we will ensure the law takes its course,” the MCA said.
Echoing the Nairobi official's statements in the same event, the National Assembly Majority leader, Kimani Ichung'wah, stressed the need for the public to remain peaceful during their demonstrations. According to Ichung'wah, the government will not allow vandalising county infrastructure.
“Nairobi will not become Mogadishu. We cannot allow this. Those burning county assets, destroying businesses, setting vehicles on fire, and vandalising infrastructure are not seeking justice—that is criminal behaviour, not a pursuit of justice,” he said.
On Thursday, June 12, some of the protesters who took to the streets to demonstrate against the recent death of Albert Ojwang were seen uninstalling the newly erected dustbins and streetlights, which are barely a month old.
In videos seen by Kenyans.co.ke, a number of the bins were removed from their original posts, with protesters carrying them along the road as they dragged them along.
Speaking when the installation kicked off on Sunday, May 18, Nairobi County Chief Officer for Environment, Mosiria, stated that the bins were put in place to serve pedestrians after the previously installed ones were stolen.
On the other hand, the county government had installed modern street lighting systems, which Sakaja asserts will be fundamental in enhancing the visibility, security, and ambience of the city.
After their installation, the county had issued stern warnings to both city dwellers and hawkers against destroying them.

Outrage Erupts Over Police Social Media Post,"It is officially the third Sunday of June, the day set aside to celebrate fathers worldwide. True to form, several government institutions have already started celebrating Father's Day through sentimental posters on social media.
Leading the pack at quarter to 6am was the National Police Service (NPS), which took to social media to celebrate fathers in a simple Father's Day post, unaccompanied by any sentimental caption.
However, the stealth post did not escape Kenyans' attention, as they came out of the woodwork early Sunday morning to criticise the institution's recent miscarriage of justice that left a father childless and a child fatherless.
In a series of replies, Kenyans reminded the police service of the death of blogger and teacher Albert Ojwang in custody, who was the only child of his father.
A Father's Day post by the National Police Service on Sunday, June 15, 2025. PHOTO NATIONAL POLICE SERVICE
""It is not a happy Father's Day for Baba Albert Ojwang and Albert's son,"" one such user stated, followed by another one, writing, ""he was also someone's father,"" with an image of Ojwang.
""What is happy about Father's Day when you are making children fatherless?"" another quipped.
Within the hour, the comment section turned into a tribute to Albert Ojwang, who left behind an infant son and a heartbroken father after his death at Central Police Station last weekend.
The post highlighted the mistrust that has festered between the police and civilians, a sentiment that was captured by one X user, asserting that even police officers' children now feel ashamed of their parents' professions.
""The mistrust between the public and police makes your children think twice before introducing themselves to peers as the offspring of policemen. It is not as simple as introducing oneself as ""my father is a pilot, doctor, engineer or plant operator',"" the user wrote.
Activist Hanifa Adan, who currently writes for the Daily Nation, even dedicated her weekly column to commemorating Ojwang with her article titled ""Father's Day Without a Son: Tears for Albert Ojwang.""
In the same X streets, the first daughter, Charlene Ruto, received a fair share of criticism after posting about her father, President William Ruto, celebrating him on the special day.
As expected, Kenyans laid out their complaints about the president in her comments section, also reflecting on Ojwang's death.
""At least you get to celebrate your father this Father’s Day. Albert would have loved to do the same, to sit with his dad, laugh, and share a meal, but those who murdered him felt so powerful, so untouchable, they played God, deciding who lives and who dies,"" one of the top comments read.
""You’ve been parading yourself as a youth leader, yet you’ve said nothing about Albert’s death. A young man was killed. As for your father... I won’t even go there. The mere thought of his name boils my blood! Just let him know that Kenyans have unanimously endorsed his Wantam!""

CCTV Footage of Albert Ojwang's Last Moments Emerges,"A new twist has emerged in the murder case of blogger Albert Ojwang after CCTV footage of his final moments surfaced.
In the clip seen by Kenyans.co.ke, a police vehicle is seen driving into Mbagathi Hospital at 1:35 am. Three officers then emerge from the vehicle, and two of them engage in a brief conversation before walking towards the casualty section of the health facility.
During this time, Ojwang remains at the back of the vehicle, unattended. The officers then reappear at 1:37 am and seem to be making phone calls.
A police vehicle carrying the remains of Albert Ojwang arrives at Mbagathi Hospital on June 8, 2025.
At 1:46 am, two officers emerge from the hospital with a stretcher that is later used to carry Ojwang. They take approximately 12 minutes before loading him onto the stretcher, after requesting assistance from a hospital guard.
Police load Albert Ojwang onto a stretcher at 1:59 am.
Notably, this is now 24 minutes since the police vehicle arrived, highlighting the lack of urgency in attending to Ojwang.
The officers then spend a further 10 minutes in the casualty section and, at 2:11 am, wheel out Ojwang's body, seemingly after the hospital confirmed that the blogger was deceased.
Albert Ojwang is wheeled out of Mbagathi Hospital at 2:11 am.
At 2:15 am, the police vehicle leaves the hospital with the remains of the late Ojwang.
The footage closely matches an earlier report by medics at Mbagathi Hospital, who noted that Ojwang was brought to the facility at around 2 am on June 8 and was unresponsive.
The report indicated that Ojwang had extensive injuries and a swollen face. His limbs also bore a series of severe bruises, highlighting the violent nature of the attack.
This development comes just a day after another suspect was arrested by authorities on allegations of deleting CCTV footage at Nairobi's Central Police Station, where Ojwang was held before his death.
The man is said to have been arrested on the morning of Friday, June 13, in a supposed targeted operation at his residence in a populous Nairobi estate.

According to sources privy to the situation, the technician, who had overseen the installation of all 25 cameras at the station in 2024, was called on June 8, by a police officer at Central Police Station. Aside from the cameras, the man also installed a digital video recorder (DVR) where all captured footage is stored.
The man claims that the officer urged him to report to the station immediately. Upon arrival, he was taken to the office of a senior officer, where the DVR is housed and was allegedly asked to delete footage from Thursday, June 6, and Friday, June 7.",https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/113117-cctv-footage-shows-albert-ojwangs-final-moments
EPRA Announces Fuel Prices for June-July,"Super petrol prices are set to increase following the latest fuel review by the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA). On the other hand, prices for diesel and kerosene are set to decrease.
In the review released on Saturday, June 14, EPRA revealed that petrol had increased by Ksh2.69 per litre, while diesel and kerosene had decreased by Ksh1.95 and Ksh2.06 per litre, respectively.
Consequently, super petrol will retail at Ksh177.32, diesel at Ksh162.91, and kerosene at Ksh146.93 per litre in Nairobi. 
EPRA noted that the calculated maximum retail prices of petroleum products will be in force from Saturday, June 15, to Monday, July 14.

""In accordance with Section 101(y) of the Petroleum Act 2019 and Legal Notice No.192 of 2022, we have calculated the maximum retail prices of petroleum products which will be in force from June 15 to July 14,"" the statement read in part.
""The prices are inclusive of the 16% Value Added Tax (VAT) in line with the provisions of the Finance Act 2023, the Tax Laws (Amendment) Act 2024, and the revised rates for excise duty adjusted for inflation as per Legal Notice No. 194 of 2020,"" it added.
In Mombasa, super petrol, diesel, and kerosene will all retail at Ksh174.01, Ksh159.62 and Ksh143.64 per litre, respectively. In the lakeside region of Kisumu, the prices of super petrol, diesel and kerosene were set at Ksh177.28, Ksh163.23 and Ksh147.30 per litre, respectively.
Super petrol in Nakuru will retail at Ksh176.47 per litre. Meanwhile, diesel and kerosene will retail at Ksh162.41 and Ksh146.47 per litre, respectively. In Eldoret, super petrol, diesel and kerosene will retail at Ksh177.28, Ksh163.24 and Ksh147.30 per litre, respectively.
According to EPRA, the average landed cost of imported super petrol increased by 0.35 per cent from US$588.16 (Ksh76,166) per cubic metre in April 2025 to US$590.24 (Ksh76,436) in May 2025.
Conversely, diesel decreased by 2.42 per cent from US$594.60 (Ksh77,000) per cubic metre to US$580.23 (Ksh75,139) while Kerosene decreased by 5.14 per cent from US$599.84 (Ksh77,679) per cubic metre to US$569.00 (Ksh73,685) per cubic metre over the same period.
EPRA explained that the price of petroleum products was based on global market trends, as Kenya does not produce or refine its own petroleum; it imports already processed fuel from other countries.
The latest prices are expected to be received with mixed feelings, as motorists on Kenyan roads drive both super petrol and diesel-fuelled vehicles.
Even so, attention now shifts to next month, as Kenyans remain on the lookout for global oil price movements and upcoming EPRA reviews.

Kenya Air Force Plane Crashes,"Two Kenya Air Force officers were on Saturday, June 14, killed in a plane crash in Kwale County.
The officers were killed in Ndavaya, Kinango, in an incident that was confirmed by County Commissioner Stephen Orinde.
Further, the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) released a statement confirming the incident and also explained the circumstances that seemingly caused the crash.
Despite confirming two officers on board, they neither confirmed nor denied that the crash claimed the lives of the military personnel.

""Earlier today, 14th June 2025, a Kenya Air Force Grob 120A aircraft experienced an emergency while on a training flight in the general area of Mwakijembe Primary School, Ndavaya, Kwale County,' KDF stated.
""On Board were two pilots. Recovery is ongoing,"" added Kenya's military body.
According to flight records, the ill-fated aircraft departed Mombasa at 11:39 am and was last seen near Diani before disappearing from radar. It crashed at approximately 12:06 pm, just 27 minutes after takeoff.
Images obtained by Kenyans.co.ke showed the disintegrated state of the plane's wreckage, with the roof of the aircraft completely undone. 
Out of the cockpit, only the seats remained, with the nose of the plane left with just spare parts. 
Compared with the plane's tail, which had limited damage, the front section was completely damaged, supposedly signalling the plane nose-dived to the ground. 
The scene of the crash was an open field with vegetation, and other reports suggested that it was a common training area for military personnel. Aside from the two officers, no civilian casualties were reported at the time of publishing.
In the aftermath of the incident, curious onlookers started milling around the scene even as emergency response teams were deployed to the crash site to assist in search and recovery operations.

Babu Owino Sounds Alarm Over Masked Police at Protests,"Embakasi East MP Paul Ongili, popularly known as Babu Owino, has called on Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja to enforce a court ruling that bars police officers from wearing facial masks during protests.
In an official statement, Babu condemned the continued defiance of the ruling issued by Justice Bahati Mwamuye, which declared the use of masks by officers during public demonstrations unconstitutional.
Justice Mwamuye ruled that the use of face coverings by law enforcement officers, especially during protests, violates the principles of accountability and transparency and hinders the identification of state agents when exercising coercive power.
The MP expressed his frustrations that, despite the ruling, officers continued covering their faces during public protests.

“It is unacceptable that despite this judicial pronouncement, certain elements within the police service continue to disregard the law with impunity,” Babu stated.
To ensure that the police remain compliant with this ruling, Babu has called upon Kanja to issue an immediate directive that will ensure the police are following the rule.
“No officer should engage the public in anonymity, especially while wielding force in the name of the state,” Babu continued.
According to the MP, Kenya should not be left to slide back into a culture of faceless repression. Babu emphasised the importance of all Kenyans, including officers, obeying the law.
“The law is clear, and it must be obeyed by all, especially by those entrusted to enforce it,” the MP continued.
Police officers have been spotted covering their faces during public protests while using force to disperse Kenyans. The latest case was witnessed on Thursday, June 12.
During the protests, where Kenyans had taken to the streets to demand justice for Albert Ojwang, who had died in police custody, Shakira Wafula, an activist, approached an officer and forcibly pulled off his mask. The officer was part of a contingent deployed to repulse protesters who gathered in the city.
In videos that made the rounds online, Wafula was seen striving to reach for the cloth covering his face, which she grabbed and began pulling off while the officer tried to block her. She eventually pulled it off and quickly ran away.
The issue of masked police officers gained national attention during the 2024 Gen Z protests, when it was noted that these officers killed some protestors, but identifying them became difficult as they had hidden their faces.

World Leaders Raise Concern Over Kenya’s Capacity in Haiti Mission,"Kenya’s capacity to lead the Multinational Security Support Mission (MSSM) in Haiti has come under scrutiny once again after a world leader voiced dissatisfaction with the mission’s progress.
Brazil’s President, Inácio Lula da Silva, on Friday became the latest global figure to call for a stronger security presence in Haiti, as the underfunded and understaffed United Nations-backed mission continues to struggle against the country’s escalating gang crisis.
Speaking during a meeting with Caribbean nations in Brazil’s capital, Brasília, Lula urged the UN to either provide more funding for the current mission structure or upgrade it to an official UN peacekeeping operation.
He cited the mission’s importance to restoring stability to the gang-ridden nation and in the long-term ambitions of establishing democracy in the nation via holding Presidential Elections.

The mission is led by Kenyan forces, with additional support from personnel drawn from Jamaica, Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, and the Bahamas.
Currently, the United Nations manages the mission’s funding, which relies on voluntary contributions from member states. While several countries have pledged financial support, much of the money is yet to be disbursed. So far, the UN Trust Fund has confirmed pledges amounting to $96.8 million (approximately Ksh12.4 billion).
Kenya has been forced to spend its funds, with reports recently emerging that the country had allocated Ksh2.1 billion for the mission. This, however, put the President William Ruto-led administration on the spot, prompting a response from Foreign Affairs Principal Secretary Korir Sing’oei.
In November last year, the Principal Secretary clarified that the funds spent by Kenya would eventually be reimbursed, describing the arrangement as standard procedure. “This is the normal practice. The resources will certainly be reimbursed to Kenya. The financing mechanism for it is through a trust fund, which enables countries to make contributions,” he stated.
A transition to a formal UN peacekeeping mission, which would guarantee stable and predictable funding, would require approval by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). While the United States has expressed support for such a move, permanent members Russia and China, who hold veto powers, have opposed it.
In recent months, several world leaders, including those from France, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, and even the Haitian government, have joined the growing calls for increased support to stabilise Haiti.
For its part, Kenya had expressed its support for the Haitian government’s request to the Security Council to authorise planning for the transformation of the multinational force to a UN peacekeeping force. 
Monica Juma, the National Security Advisor to Ruto, in a previous address to the UNSC, voiced Kenya’s support in that regard. 
“Today, Haiti has appealed to the Security Council to consider the transformation of the MSS mission to a UN peacekeeping operation soon. Kenya strongly supports this appeal. A peacekeeping operation will avail greater resources to the mission predictably and sustainably. It will also provide a broader platform for collaboration and participation of more patterns,” she noted. 
Aside from the financial issues, Kenya’s mission in Haiti has reportedly been hampered by technical and administrative issues. Reports of Kenyan police officers lamenting about the lack of quality equipment to handle Haitian gangs have been reported.
Also, claims of the Haitian National Police (HNP) at loggerheads over the Mission’s effectiveness have emerged, but the Kenyan government has always shut down such reports.

KeNHA Announces Temporary Closure of Bridge,"The Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) and Homa Bay County have announced the temporary closure of the Kanyadhiang' Bridge in Kendu Bay to allow for urgent repairs to the approach slab.
In a joint statement, KeNHA and Governor Gladys Wanga announced that the closure is effective from Saturday, June 14, and is expected to last several days as engineers work to restore the bridge’s full functionality.
''We wish to inform the public about the temporary closure of Kanyadhiang' Bridge in Kendu Bay to allow for urgent repairs on the approach slab,'' the joint statement read in part.
''We would like to assure all road users that while repair works are being carried out on the approach slab, the bridge's main structure remains completely safe and stable,'' the statement continued.

Despite the closure, KeNHA has assured the public that the main structure of the bridge remains safe and stable, with only the approach slab requiring reinforcement.
The Authority has deployed teams to fast-track the repair process, ensuring minimal disruption to road users.
While the repairs continue, motorists travelling towards Kindi Bay have been advised to use alternative routes, including a diversion route via the Goshen Hotel, Oluch Intake Bridge, Nyangajo Primary School, and Obama Road, which will reconnect them to the main highway.
Those coming from the Homa Bay direction have been directed to follow the same route in reverse. The alternative path spans approximately five kilometres.
Traffic marshals and police have been strategically positioned to ensure compliance among motorists.
''We request all road users to drive carefully and follow instructions from traffic police and marshals stationed at the diversion points,'' the statement continued.
While the exact day when the bridge will be reopened has not been revealed, KeNHA anticipates that normal traffic flow will resume shortly after the completion of repairs.
KeNHA emphasised that the repairs are necessary to prevent further deterioration of the bridge, which has been experiencing structural strain due to increased traffic and heavy rainfall in recent months.

Charlene Ruto Proposes Way Forward on Albert Ojwang Murder,"President William Ruto's daughter, Charlene Ruto, has joined Kenyans in mourning the death of Albert Ojwang.
Breaking her silence on the incident that occurred a week ago, Charlene called for national reflection and a generational ceasefire to address rising cases of police brutality.
Speaking after the Youth Leadership Forum in Nairobi, Charlene led the 106 participants in observing a moment of silence for the 31-year-old teacher and social media influencer, whose death in police custody sparked public outrage.
She noted that the tragedy had driven her to deep reflection as she tried to understand the circumstances surrounding Ojwang’s death.

She revealed that the situation was both painful and unfortunate while extending her condolences to the bereaved family.
""I have struggled with deep moments of reflection for the past few days to try and find context around what happened. This is a painful, unfortunate and overwhelming loss, and we share our deepest condolences with his family,"" Charlene wrote in a Twitter post.
Ojwang, a well-known blogger and activist, was arrested in Homa Bay and later detained at Central Police Station in Nairobi, where he died under unclear circumstances.
In response, Charlene called for a generational ceasefire among the youth, urging a shift away from rising extremism, political hostility, and intolerance.
She challenged young people to take responsibility and work towards building the kind of society they wish to live in.
""As a young Kenyan, I would also like to challenge the entire country to embrace a generational ceasefire. These regrettable incidents, extremity and growing intolerance should challenge all of us as a nation to interrogate the environment and culture we want to live in and create for the generations coming after us,"" the President's daughter wrote.
Ojwang's death has become a symbol of Kenya's ongoing struggle with police brutality, which has claimed the lives of many.
Already, Nairobi Central Police OCS Samsob Talam, and Constable James Mukhwana, the sentry who was on duty when Ojwang was brought in, have been arrested as investigations into the incident death continue.

"Police Bust CBD-Based Phone Theft Syndicate, Recover 75 Phones","An intelligence-led operation by the National Police Service resulted in the arrest of three suspects believed to be part of a Nairobi-based phone theft syndicate.
Through a statement, officers revealed the arrest of the three on Friday, June 13, in the Tsavo area in the Central Business District (CBD).
Aside from the arrests, police recovered 75 mobile phones, seven computers, one microscope, and 20 Universal Flashing Interface (UFI) gadgets.
“On 13 June 2025, police officers from Nairobi Area conducted an intelligence-led operation along Tsavo Street in Nairobi’s Central Business District (CBD),” NPS stated.

“During the operation, three suspects were arrested, and 75 mobile phones, seven computers, one microscope, and twenty Universal Flashing Interface (UFI) gadgets were recovered,” they added.
The authorities disclosed that the suspects were in police custody as investigations continued, pending arraignment in court.
At the same time, the police warned the public against involvement in mobile phone theft syndicates and the illegal trade of flashing stolen phones, advising against buying devices from unauthorised dealers.
Phone theft, especially in the heart of Nairobi, is common, with reports of victims of phone theft emerging daily. Unconfirmed reports typically indicate that the stolen phones are taken to downtown Nairobi, where they are flashed and prepared for resale.
The result is a section of unsuspecting Kenyans purchasing these phones, unaware that they are putting themselves on the precipice of being caught on the wrong side of the law.
The phones are normally sold at affordable prices, with many eager to acquire the phones on such good deals. However, most of them do not know that, despite being unaware at the time of purchase, they can still be charged by law for the possession of a stolen mobile device if arrested by authorities.
Recently, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) in April announced the arrest of a phone thief behind a notorious phone theft syndicate in Naivasha.
Through a statement, DCI revealed that the suspect was caught red-handed as he was flashing his latest collection of stolen mobile phones. During the raid, detectives disclosed the recovery of 27 stolen phones, a laptop and the mobile flashing kit.

Why Irungu Nyakera Wants SGR Renamed 'Uhuru Rail',"Former Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC) chairperson Irungu Nyakera has suggested that the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) be renamed with a local name like Uhuru Rail to localise it and make it more profitable.
Since its construction, the SGR has been a transformative infrastructural project linking Nairobi and Mombasa while facilitating cargo transport across the country.
However, over the years, concerns have been raised over its performance, profitability, and viability to the country.
Recent reports indicated a decline in passenger numbers, prompting discussions on how to make it more efficient, profitable, and more Kenyan.

According to the latest data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), SGR passengers dropped by 282,000 last year compared to 2023. Cargo transport via SGR also saw a slight decline, with freight volume dropping from 6,533,000 tonnes in 2023 to 6,531,000 tonnes in 2024.
These declines led to a 50 per cent fare hike introduced in January 2024, which saw economy-class tickets rise from Ksh1,000 to Ksh1,500, and first-class fares jump from Ksh3,000 to Ksh4,500.
Following these developments, Nyakera listed 10 key steps Kenya can implement to improve SGR's performance. Among them is renegotiating SGR loan terms to extend repayment periods and lower interest rates.
Other critical recommendations he has made include the localisation of operations, ensuring that more Kenyan professionals are hired to manage and maintain the railway, switching from diesel to electric trains, and allowing trains to double-stack (carry an extra container on top), like other modern railways, to increase capacity.
He also suggested completing the Naivasha–Kampala line and prioritising the development of Kisumu Port, incentivising cargo from Mombasa by giving businesses tax or cost incentives to move cargo by rail instead of trucks, and building loading stations and dry ports next to industries to allow manufacturers to ship directly via SGR.
Nyakera also suggested growing the passenger services between major cities, allowing licensed private players like cement companies, logistics firms, and agri-exporters to run their own trains on the SGR, and renaming it with a local name.
According to Nyakera, renaming SGR to a new name like Uhuru Rail or KenRail will give it a Kenyan identity, making Kenyans own it more and reinforcing it as a national asset.
Nyakera believes that with these changes, SGR could reverse its passenger decline, improve cargo efficiency, and solidify its role as a cornerstone of national development

Govt Introduces Bold New Graphic Warnings on All Tobacco Products,"The Ministry of Health has introduced new graphic health warnings on all tobacco products nationwide.
Through a statement released on Friday, June 13, the ministry revealed it had gazetted the third batch of 13 warnings to promote effective tobacco control and the protection of public health.
The new warnings, which are also translated into Swahili and feature approved pictures and pictograms, must now appear on all tobacco product packaging.
“This intervention aims to increase public awareness of tobacco-related health risks, deter tobacco use, especially among youth, and protect non-smokers and vulnerable populations,” noted the ministry.

The first warning, split into two, reads “WARNING! SMOKING HARMS PEOPLE NEXT TO YOU” and “WARNING! THIS PRODUCT HARMS PEOPLE NEXT TO YOU.”
The second warning reads “WARNING! TOBACCO USE CAUSES LUNG DISEASE.” Notably, all the warnings should be capitalised. It is complemented by a graphic portraying lungs that have not been subjected to tobacco use and those of a perennial smoker.
The third warning ought to be “WARNING! TOBACCO USE HARMS YOUR UNBORN BABY.” It is accompanied by a graphic of a pregnant woman smoking a cigarette.
The fourth warning must read “WARNING! TOBACCO USE CAUSES HEART DISEASE.” It features a graphic of a healthy heart and a smoker’s heart.
The fifth warning reads “WARNING! TOBACCO USE CAUSES INFERTILITY.” It is accompanied by a blurred-out image of a woman outside a fertility clinic, sulking over her inability to conceive.
Concurrently, the sixth warning states, “WARNING! TOBACCO USE CAUSES IMPOTENCE.” It features a graphic of a bent cigarette.
The seventh warning, also split into two, is centred around the risk of suffering from mouth cancer. The first section reads “WARNING!

Another Kenyan Dies in Police Custody,"A stock theft suspect who had been held at the Katito Police Station in Kisumu has died while in police custody.
According to the station's police, the suspect died by suicide after he allegedly used his vest to hang himself on the cell door.
He had been arrested on suspicion of stealing goats and was held in solitary confinement. Police at the station said they were alerted to a commotion coming from the cell on June 13 at about 10:00 am.
Upon checking the source of the commotion, they realised the suspect had allegedly hanged himself.

His body was moved to the Nyando Morgue pending investigations.
This case comes barely two days after yet another suspect died by alleged suicide at the Ukwala police station in Siaya county on June 12.
The body of the 26-year-old was found hanging on a metal rod in the cells’ toilet, police said. He had been arrested following the issuance of a warrant by a court in the area.
The suspect had been accused of defilement. Police said he hanged himself in a toilet at the cells using his shirt.
According to the police at the Ukwala Police Station, the suspect was found hanging on a metal water pipe with his shirt around his neck.
These subsequent cases of alleged suicide in police stations follow the case of teacher and social media influencer Albert Ojwang, who police had initially alleged had died by suicide at the Central Police Station.
Police claimed Ojwang had self-inflicted injuries by hitting himself on the wall severally.
However, preliminary investigations by the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) and a government pathologist have disputed this claim, revealing that Ojwang died from head injuries, neck compression, and multiple bruises, suggesting blunt force trauma and strangulation.
These cases continue to raise questions about the safety of Kenyans in police custody, which is expected to be the safest place, yet is now turning out to be one of the most unsafe.

McDonald Mariga & Victor Wanyama Lose Mother,"Mildred Wanyama, the mother of Kenyan football legends Victor Wanyama and McDonald Mariga, is dead.
Through a statement released on Saturday, June 14, Mariga revealed the news of their mother’s passing, adding that she passed away in the early hours of Saturday.
He further added that burial arrangements were underway and that further details would be communicated soon.
“It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved mother, who left us peacefully today morning,” Mariga stated.

He added: “We are currently making arrangements and will share more details soon! Thank you.”
Mildred, a sporting icon herself, was married to Noah Wanyama, a former footballer who played for AFC Leopards. Together, they had five children: four boys and one girl. Their children include Mariga, Victor, Thomas and Sylvester Wanyama, who are all footballers, and Mercy Wanyama, a professional basketballer in Spain.
Mildred was a netball player in her youth. She met her husband, Noah, in the 1970s when they were both working for Kenya Railways and involved in sports.
She was known for being very supportive of her children's careers and expressed immense pride in their achievements.
Famously, she intervened when Mariga, her eldest son, considered joining the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) after Form Three, insisting he complete his secondary education. This decision was significant, as it later paved the way for his future success on the European football stage with Italian giants Inter Milan.
With Victor, she has been highlighted as crucial to nurturing the talents of a child who would later become the first Kenyan to play in the prestigious English Premier League (EPL).
Victor also ascended to the role of national team captain, leading the Harambee Stars in the 2019 African Cup of Nations, the first time Kenya featured in more than a decade.
Beyond motherhood, she was a trailblazer in women’s sports administration, holding senior leadership positions within netball.
Notably, she held the position of Kenya Netball Federation President from 2014 to 2018. 
Aside from that, she actively participated in community and family events, always projecting an image of strength and grace. Her presence at her children's significant milestones, both on and off the field, was a constant source of pride for the family.

Kenya Nominates DCI Boss Amin for INTERPOL Role,"Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen has nominated the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI)'s Director, Mohamed Amin, as Kenya’s candidate for election to the INTERPOL Executive Committee, representing the African region.
The move by the CS is aimed at amplifying Africa’s voice in global security matters.
The elections are set to take place during the 93rd session of the INTERPOL General Assembly, scheduled to take place in Marrakech, Morocco, from November 24 to 27.
Speaking on Friday during the 11th Regional Centre on Small Arms and Light Weapons (RECSA) Council in Nairobi, the Interior CS urged the members to support Amin’s candidacy, terming it a national milestone and a continental opportunity to shape global policing policy.

“Kenya’s win will provide an opportunity to champion Africa’s perspectives and priorities at the highest level of global policing,” Murkomen said during the RECSA meeting.
The INTERPOL Executive Committee is a governing body responsible for supervising the execution of decisions made by the General Assembly and overseeing the administration of INTERPOL’s General Secretariat.
Key responsibilities of the INTERPOL Executive Committee include supervising INTERPOL operations, setting agendas, overseeing the Secretary General, promoting international collaboration, and representing regional interests.
If elected, Amin would represent African nations within INTERPOL’s leadership, ensuring that Africa’s security concerns, such as cross-border crime, terrorism, and corruption, are prioritised in global policing strategies.
His role would involve liaising with African law enforcement agencies, advocating for capacity-building programmes, and ensuring effective crime-fighting measures across the continent.
With over 30 years in law enforcement, Amin brings deep experience in criminal investigations, counter-terrorism, and international cooperation.
The DCI boss has led high-profile investigations and testified at the ICC. He holds a Master’s in Criminology and has been decorated with top state honours, including EBS, MBS, and OGW.
As DCI Director, he also oversees INTERPOL's Eastern Africa bureau and has championed reforms in ethics, modernisation, and intelligence sharing. The DCI boss is widely respected for his integrity, leadership, and commitment to community-based policing.

Margaret Kenyatta Sends Message to Gen Zs,"Kenyan youth, particularly Gen Zs, were on Friday, June 13, urged to use their talents to build a better world and challenge the status quo.
While speaking to 170 graduating students at Brookhouse School's 17th graduation ceremony, former First Lady Margaret Kenyatta urged youth to be “architects of global change”, expressing her admiration for the new “bold” generation.
Further, she acknowledged the courage of Gen Zs in challenging the status quo, noting it was critical in ensuring global transformation and confronting injustices.
“You have learned to leverage your talents, not just for personal success, but to build a better world by contributing your gifts and brilliant minds to the world,” Margaret stated.

“I see a bold generation rising, one ready to question the status quo, reimagine the future, and confront injustices,” she said.
Margaret, who mostly stays away from the public limelight, noted that the brilliance of the youth must drive innovation, experiment with new ideas, and build a new world away from the chaos that is engulfing it.
“Go forth and shine. Wherever life takes you, let your light transform the world,” she asserted.
Her message follows former President Uhuru Kenyatta’s challenge to Gen Zs to continue fighting for their rights amidst various governance issues experienced during the tenure of his successor, William Ruto.
While speaking during the burial of his cousin, veteran rally driver Kibathi Muigai in January, Uhuru did not hide his thoughts on the rising influence of Kenyan youth on political discourse.
Uhuru, who has largely shied away from speaking on politics since he left office in 2022, asked the youth to continue fighting for their rights.
“The problem with people nowadays is that they are afraid. Gen Zs are the story of the future. Fight for your rights. Fight to ensure you are getting what is rightfully yours,” he urged.
He went on to add, “Don't stand and watch as your wealth is taken from you. Everything is worth fighting for. If you do not fight for it, don't cry if it is taken away.”
Uhuru was pleading with youths, including his daughter Ngina Kenyatta, to also join the fight, arguing it was time for him and his peers to rest and hand over the fight.

Obado Dealt Fresh Blow by EACC in Ongoing Wealth Probe,"Former Migori Governor Okoth Obado is set to lose assets worth Ksh428 million after the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) officially begins the auctioning process on June 23.
In 2024, Obado and the EACC struck a deal in which he surrendered several assets for the anti-graft body to drop cases on unexplained wealth against him, his children, and others.
The consent was recorded before High Court judge Esther Maina, where the EACC said they had settled the matter out of court and that it did not wish to pursue the two cases of Ksh1.9 billion and Ksh73 million involving unexplained wealth and proceeds of crime against Obado, his four children, businessman Jared Peter Oluoch Kwaga, and his firms.
“In that process, our and his lawyers met and they were able to agree in a process of negotiations where we agreed on the minimum amount we are to recover,” EACC CEO Abdi Ahmed Mohamoud revealed.

According to EACC, the auction process will officially begin on June 23, starting in Nairobi, then later extending to Kisumu and Migori, where more properties will be seized and auctioned.
The properties, believed to have been acquired through misappropriated public funds, will be auctioned, and the money returned to public projects.
Among the lush properties to be auctioned are luxurious residences in Nairobi, including a Ksh40 million Loresho Ridge house, a Ksh22 million apartment in Riara, two Greenspan maisonettes worth Ksh14.5 million, and an unfinished plot in Runda valued at Ksh50 million.
The Assets Recovery Agency (ARA) and EACC are leading the efforts to seize these assets. Initially, EACC had sought to recover the entire Ksh1.9 billion, but a negotiated agreement led to the surrender of properties worth Ksh428 million.
Mohamud revealed that the recovered funds will be deposited into Kenya’s Consolidated Fund, supporting public services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure development.
The commission hopes that such high-profile seizures will deter other public officials from engaging in corruption.
However, the EACC CEO raised concerns that while Kenyans report cases of graft involving politicians, when the commission begins the process of arrest and asset recovery, the same Kenyans rush to the defence of the accused.
“The moment we investigate, the same public that wanted action begins to shield the politician,” Mohamoud said.
This is among the many cases the commission is handling as it seeks to alleviate cases of graft among high-profile leaders in the country.

Fuel Tanker Explodes in Nakuru,"A massive fire erupted at Barnabas stage, Pipeline area, in Nakuru County, in the early hours of Saturday, June 14.
The fire is said to have broken out after a fuel tanker explosion caused multiple tankers to catch fire, with footage obtained by Kenyans.co.ke showing the blaze consuming the tankers.
Emergency response teams were seen on the ground battling to contain the blaze as it threatened to spread quickly to neighbouring areas.
While it remains unclear what led to the fuel tanker explosion, preliminary reports indicate that no casualties were reported.

As a result, the massive fire shut down the busy Nakuru–Nairobi Highway, caused significant disruptions, and rendered the highway impassable for hours.
Consequently, motorists were advised to avoid the area and seek alternative routes, as investigations to determine the main cause of the fire were said to have commenced.
Even so, the clips show curious onlookers milling around the scene of the fire, which appeared to have occurred within a contained area.
At the time of publishing, the police and the County Government of Nakuru had not released any official statement on the fire explosion.
The latest follows a recent night fire that broke out in the populous Kibra Estate in Nairobi that resulted in more than 100 families being forced to sleep in the cold.
Traders and homeowners bore the biggest brunt of the incident after the fire, which occurred on Wednesday, June 11, spread to their units, leaving them counting losses.
Residents reported that efforts to extinguish the fire were hampered by narrow roads, which prevented fire engines from accessing the scene.
Public Service CS Geoffrey Ruku, who visited the scene in the company of local leaders, including area MP Peter Orero, promised to release emergency aid to support them.
""Incidents of fires have become very common in informal settlements, especially in Nairobi. The government is committed to ending these tragedies to protect the lives and property of citizens,"" Ruku said.
""Early this morning, I visited Mukungu Village in Kibra, Nairobi, to support victims of a fire that left several families homeless. The government will provide emergency relief aid to the families to assist them in getting their lives back on track.""
